/**
 * DUPLICATE KEYS IN A CENSUS MAP, WHEREVER THE TYPECHECK DOES NOT REACH.
 *
 * A repeated property in an object literal is TS1117, and TypeScript catches it — in the programs
 * the typecheck compiles. The census maps that pin what a guard expects live in `test/` directories,
 * and `scripts/typecheck-test-dirs.mjs` pins fourteen of those as UNREACHED (CLAUDE.md): there, a
 * second `foo:` silently overwrites the first and the census counts one fewer sink than it lists.
 * Measured 2026-09-12 on `IN_SINKS` in `packages/api/test/input-bounds-census.test.ts`.
 *
 * So the duplicate is found by PARSING, not by compiling, and reported as `file:line`.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A CENSUS MAP: an object literal bound to a `const` whose name is SCREAMING_SNAKE.
 * That is the shape every one of them has, and it is the shape a pin has — a lower-case local is a
 * value, not a register. Only the literal's OWN top level is read; a nested object is its own
 * literal and is reached when it is one of these in its own right.
 *
 * Keys are compared as WRITTEN-OUT NAMES: `"a"` and `a` are the same property and both are read.
 * A computed key (`[EXPR]:`) is skipped — two computed keys can be the same property or not, and
 * this cannot tell, so it says nothing rather than guessing.
