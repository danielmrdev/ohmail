/**
 * A THIRD TERM ON A SENDER RULE — `rules.body_contains` (mail 0052), in the evaluator.
 *
 * The case, stated as a person would: a sender writes the SAME subject on every message —
 * "Notification" — and the text of the nightly `[NinjaFirewall]` alert is what distinguishes it
 * from the invoice. A subject term cannot split that sender; the body term is the same
 * conjunction one field deeper.
 *
 * `rules-subject.test.ts` names the three ways a green run here would be about nothing, and each
 * applies verbatim with "subject" replaced by "body": a term never consulted (so the NEGATIVE
 * assertion is in the same test as the positive one), a term that never DECIDES (so the ids are
 * pinned to make the id tie-break the wrong answer), and absence read as a term (so `null`, `""`
 * and blanks are asserted to mean "no term"). One direction is NEW here and has no subject
 * analogue: a subject-carrying rule and a body-carrying rule for one address must order
 * deterministically, and a rule carrying BOTH terms must beat either single-term rule.
 *
 * Each case below was mutated and watched go red; the mutations are named at the test that
 * catches them.
