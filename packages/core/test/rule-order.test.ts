/**
 * THE ORDER'S KIND OUTRANKS ITS EFFECT (FIX-024).
 *
 * A person the account allowed BY NAME used to be screened out by a deny rule on their domain:
 * `compareRules` ranked deny over allow before it asked how narrowly each rule names the sender,
 * so the router filed their new mail to Screened. The order now asks the kind first, and deny over
 * allow decides only between rules of one kind — the same shape the pinned term cases keep: a
 * term never overturns a screen-out (`rules-subject`, `rules-body`).
