/**
 * THE PLAIN BODY'S CEILING, AND THE COUNTER IT IS MEASURED WITH.
 *
 * `utf8ByteLength` exists because the compose editor asks this question on every keystroke and
 * `TextEncoder`/`Buffer` answer it by allocating the whole body again. A second implementation of
 * a standard encoding is only worth having if it is proved equal to the standard one, so that is
 * what this file does — over the shapes a mail body actually contains, plus the three a
 * hand-rolled counter gets wrong: a surrogate PAIR (four bytes for two units), a LONE surrogate
 * (which both encoders render as U+FFFD, three bytes), and a zero-width-joiner sequence, where
 * one glyph on screen is several code points on the wire.
