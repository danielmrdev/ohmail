/**
 * ═══ WHAT A HOST LINK CARRIES, AND WHAT DECIDES IT ═══════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A link names an ORIGIN and, where that origin's identity IS the pin, the pin. Never an address.
 * WHICH origins need one is `originNeedsPin`, asked by the desktop door, the phone and the engine.
 * The TRANSPORT is why: a same-network address is served with a key no CA vouches for, so the
 * ceremony carries the fingerprint; a tailnet origin is served by Tailscale with a real certificate
 * that ROTATES, so a pin there breaks the pairing at renewal, or — as the desktop's own key —
 * never matches and accuses the host. Three controls, one predicate.
