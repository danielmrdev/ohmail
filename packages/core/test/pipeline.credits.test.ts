/**
 * WHAT THE LEDGER IS ALLOWED TO REMEMBER.

 * `credit_ledger` is APPEND-ONLY: there is no delete path, and a value written into it is in
 * backups for good. The pipeline used to charge a classification with
 * `tryDebit(source, { mailboxId, dedupKey: key })`, and `key` is `mid:${messageIdHeader}` —
 * the raw RFC822 Message-ID, chosen by the SENDING server, carrying the sender's domain and,
 * for most ESPs, the recipient's address. The "Account isolation is absolute, and it binds staff too" invariant names both.
 *
 * The first staff change closed the admin console's *render* path. That stopped staff SEEING it and removed
 * nothing from disk. This is the producer half.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS ASSERTS A CENSUS AND NOT A FIELD NAME ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `expect(meta.dedupKey).toBeUndefined()` would pass the moment someone adds the same value
 * back under `messageKey`, `ref`, or inside a nested bag "for debugging" — which is exactly
 * how this arrived. So the assertion is over the SERIALIZED meta: no remote-controlled string
 * appears anywhere in it, under any key, at any depth. A new field carrying the sender's
 * identity fails this test without anyone having to predict its name.
