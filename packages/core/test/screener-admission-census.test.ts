/**
 * ═══ EVERY WRITER OF A SCREENER HOLD, AND WHICH CLOCK IT HAS ══════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── THE MEASUREMENT THIS FILE COMES FROM (managed plane, 2026-09-10, read-only) ────────────
 *
 * A great many messages were held at the consent gate whose own header date was more than a year
 * older than our ingest of them — most on one account, the rest on another, some very old.
 * Every one was written by the ordinary gate at CONNECT, while
 * `account_settings.screening_baseline_at` was still NULL: NULL resolves to "no cutoff", and
 * with no cutoff the gate holds every unruled sender's mail whatever its age. Nothing
 * re-ingested them and no folder was renumbered — `folder_state.updated_at` for that batch has
 * not moved since the connect day.
 *
 * The test that decides an old message is backlog was spelled INLINE in `planChange` while the
 * gate was the only writer. It is `screenerAdmits` now, because it is not: `sensitive-rescreen`
 * moves already-filed mail INTO the gate and consults no cutoff at all.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A CLASSIFICATION AND NOT "EVERY WRITER CALLS THE PREDICATE" ────────────────
 *
 * The predicate's clock is the SERVER's receive time (`Change.internalDate`) and nothing else —
 * the sender's `Date:` header is theirs to choose, and a security review has already closed that
 * door once. That clock reaches `planChange` on the wire and is NOT STORED: `messages` has no
 * `internal_date` column. So a writer working from stored rows has no truthful clock to pass,
 * and a call it could only make with `arrivedAt: null` is a call that cannot change an answer —
 * a condition whose contrary state is unreachable, which the next reader would read as a
 * guarantee.
 *
 * This census therefore pins the SET of hold writers and what each one is. A new writer fails
 * it until it is classified, which is the point: the release measured above happened because a
 * cutoff enforced at one door was taken for a cutoff.
