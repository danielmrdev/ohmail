/**
 * THE LISTENERS, TESTED AT THE LINE — the kill mechanism of 2026-08-02 and the silence of
 * 2026-08-04.
 *
 * `ImapFlow` extends `EventEmitter` and reports an asynchronous connection FAILURE — a dead
 * socket, a server `BYE`, an `ETIMEOUT` from imapflow's own `_socketTimeout` handler when the
 * client is not idling — by EMITTING `error`. Node throws when `error` is emitted with no
 * listener, `apps/worker/src/entry.ts` answers uncaught exceptions with `exit(1)` by design, and
 * so one mailbox's socket ended the whole worker every ~26 s for eight minutes.
 *
 * ── AND A CONNECTION THAT MERELY *ENDS* EMITS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY ──────────
 *
 * imapflow's `_socketClose` / `_socketEnd` / failed-IDLE-recovery paths all call `this.close()`,
 * and `close()` emits **`close`** — never `error`. The adapter listened for `error` only, so on
 * one day both production mailboxes stopped syncing for many minutes with ZERO connection events
 * anywhere in the log: `onConnectionError` never fired, the worker's `handleConnectionError` never
 * ran, and the IDLE handlers registered in `watch()` sat on a dead emitter that would never speak
 * again. The `close` block below is the fix, and the two suppression cases beside it are the two
 * ways routing `close` into an error callback goes wrong.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE AND NOT `apps/worker/test` ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `guardAsyncErrors` returns early for a client with no `.on` — which is EVERY fake in the worker
 * suite, including the fake fleet that drives `dead-connection.e2e.test.ts`. There is no worker-level
 * test that can reach these lines at all, so a `close` fix without this file would be
 * built-tested-unreachable on the day it shipped. `apps/worker/test/connection-error.e2e.test.ts`
 * proves what the worker DOES with the event; this proves the event is heard.
