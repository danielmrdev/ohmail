/**
 * THE FLAG BUDGET — the bound that was missing from the CONDSTORE fast path.
 *
 * `changesSince` capped creates by count and by bytes and capped flag changes not at all, so a
 * CONDSTORE `changedSince` after "mark all as read" across thousands of messages returned all of
 * them in one `ChangeBatch`. The worker consumes each as its own database transaction
 * (`apps/worker/src/sync.ts`), on its ONE serial queue: minutes in which no other mailbox
 * syncs, no roster pass runs, and `stop()` cannot finish inside Railway's 30 s drain.
 *
 * ── WHY THE BOUND NEEDED A RESUME POINT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY ─────────────────────
 *
 * Creates resume for free: an ingested UID joins the known-set and stops being unknown. A flag
 * has no such marker. `changedSince` is a pure function of the cursor, so "take the first 500
 * and hold the cursor" returns the SAME 500 for ever and the drain never terminates. The fix is
 * a per-folder resume UID held on the adapter, and the properties it must have are asserted
 * here — a bound that loses read state is worse than no bound at all.
