 * organizer's hot paths — once per attach for the hold, once per cycle for the routing question. So

 * after the bytes are already in hand.
 *
 * Two ceilings, because they stop different attacks and an attacker picks the cheaper: the count
 * stops many small messages, the byte accumulator stops a few enormous ones.
 *
 * And newest-first is not a preference here either. The profile is a document the organizer
 * APPENDS, newest wins, so everything this read is about is at the END of the folder — a ceiling
 * that kept the oldest records would report "nobody has published settings" for a mailbox that has.

   * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   *
   * Six cases used to live here, and every one of them exercised a fallback that read the folder
   * by sequence range when no header search was available. They were removed with it, and the
   * reason is worth writing down because "the tests went green after the code was deleted" is
   * the shape of a fix that isn't one.
   *
   * The fallback answered a FAILED ASK. A refused search, a server with no SEARCH, no usable
   * UIDNEXT, or a walk that ran out of window budget all produced the same empty-handed value an
   * empty folder produces, and the caller responded by enumerating the whole folder with
   * `UID FETCH 1:*` and keeping whatever survived two ceilings. For a valid document sitting
   * below a flood of ordinary mail that is an EMPTY result — and empty is exactly what a mailbox
   * that never published settings returns, so the effective profile lapsed with nothing logged.
   *
   * Each of the six guarded a hazard of that path — counting back from an unconfirmed total, a
   * sequence window sliding under an expunge, sources discarded before the discriminator could
   * see them. Two said so in their own comments: the discarded-source shape "only arises on the
   * path that has no SEARCH", and the expunge race needed "the fallback path, which addresses
   * messages individually". With the fallback gone the hazards are gone with it — the surviving
   * path names records by uid, and a uid does not move when the folder does.

/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  ABSENT IS AN ANSWER — A FOLDER THAT HOLDS NO DOCUMENT SAYS SO, AND THE WRITER MAY CREATE ONE
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Measured on the 0.18.0 release candidate, and reproduced at 0.17.0: `ohmail/_meta` held three
 * lease claims and no settings document — a fixture reset had deleted the messages while the uid
 * space kept the weeks of heartbeats behind it. The person pressed Organize, the takeover was
 * authorized, and from that moment every write refused `profile_gap_too_deep` at
 * `op: list_profiles`: the reader could not reach uid 1 inside two budgets, answered "could not
 * ask", and the WRITER cannot create a first document while it cannot see whether one exists. Run
 * setup to the end wrote no settings; the row read Organized · Up to date; eight appended
 * messages stayed in INBOX for ever.
 *
 * The walk's honesty rule stands and is the reason this took a new answer rather than a relaxed
 * refusal: an empty window is not an absent document, because something may lie below. What is
 * new is that a COMPLETE search can prove absence — and completeness is affordable when the cost
 * is read off the MESSAGE COUNT rather than the uid range. A folder inside
 * `PROFILE_MESSAGES_MAX_PER_FETCH` is searched once over `1:*`; `profile_gap_too_deep` survives
 * for the folder that is deep AND populous, which is the only one no bounded read can settle.
