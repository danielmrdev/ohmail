/**
 * INGEST ORDER IS WHAT THE CLIENT SEES FIRST, AND IT WAS UID ORDER.
 *
 * `fetchCapped` sorted the candidate UIDs descending and called the result `newestFirst`. UID
 * is an arrival counter, not a clock: on a real mailbox a high uid can carry an old date,
 * and a lower uid a newer one. Because the worker commits
 * `batch.creates` in array order (`apps/worker/src/sync.ts`) and each commit allocates the
 * next `change_log.seq`, ingest order IS the order `/sync` hands the client its mailbox. So
 * the first page of a fresh account's bootstrap was an arbitrary slice of its history —
 * measured on a seeded account: the newest mail did not arrive until page 4 of
 * 34, and page 1 spanned 2023-01-01 to 2025-12-26. That is the reported "the Screener suddenly
 * jumps to 2025".
 *
 * The fix is ordering, not throughput. Raising the page size was measured and rejected:
 * server cost is linear in rows, so the whole drain takes the same time at any page size of rows
 * — larger pages only buy round-trips and cost a larger response body.
 *
 * ── WHAT THESE TESTS PIN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. the Date: header wins, because it is the field the UI sorts by — and because a mailbox
 *     migrated by a tool that APPENDed without preserving INTERNALDATE has every message
 *     stamped with the import time, which would leave the fix with a constant sort key;
 *  2. INTERNALDATE is the fallback when a message carries no Date: header;
 *  3. UID descending is the tiebreak, which is what keeps the pre-existing
 *     `imap.changes.backfill.test.ts` — 25 messages appended within one second — meaningful;
 *  4. re-ordering does not break the drain: the cursor is still HELD while truncated, and
 *     every message still arrives exactly once.
