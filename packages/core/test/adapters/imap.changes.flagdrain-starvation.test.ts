/**
 * THE FLAG DRAIN'S RESUME POINT UNDER A **SHARED** BUDGET — the stall that left a real
 * mailbox with `initial_import_completed_at` NULL for four days.
 *
 * `imap.changes.flagbudget.test.ts` proves the drain resumes correctly when it is the only
 * claimant on the budget. It cannot see this, because the budget is ONE object spent across all
 * of `WATCHED_FOLDERS` in order (`changesSince`, "ONE budget for the whole call") and that file's
 * fake serves INBOX alone. Everything below needs a SECOND folder that reaches the flag pass
 * with the budget already spent.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The pass recorded its resume point as `lastFlagUid + 1`, where `lastFlagUid` started at 0 and
 * only ever moved when a flag change was ACCEPTED. So a folder that reached the loop with
 * `budget.flags <= 0` broke on its first known UID having accepted nothing, and wrote
 * `resumeUid: 1` — not "no progress this pass" but **"start over"**, discarding every UID the
 * folder had already drained on earlier cycles. `flagsTruncated` then held the folder cursor, so
 * the next cycle re-read the identical range from the beginning.
 *
 * That is a permanent stall rather than a slow one, and the difference is what made it survive
 * days of healthy cycles: the drain does not need to be starved CONTINUOUSLY. It needs only to be
 * starved more often than it can finish. A folder needing four clean cycles, reset by an INBOX
 * burst every third, never reaches the end — and `hasBacklog` is true on every one of those
 * cycles, so `stampInitialImportComplete` (apps/worker/src/index.ts, gated on
 * `hasBacklog === false`) is never reached and the mailbox reads as "still importing" for ever.
 *
 * The unknown-UID `continue` above the budget check is the same mistake in the other direction:
 * a UID that is not in the known-set WAS examined — unknown-ness is an answer, not a skip — and
 * leaving the cursor behind it means the next pass re-reads it from the server for nothing.
 *
 * ── THE FIX THESE TESTS PIN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `lastFlagUid` means "the highest UID this pass EXAMINED": seeded at `from - 1`, so a pass that
 * accepted nothing records no progress instead of rewinding, and advanced on unknown UIDs as well
 * as accepted ones. Two independent lines, each watched red on its own below.
 *
 * An anti-stall floor of the kind `fetchCapped` has for creates — admit the first candidate of a
 * folder however spent the budget — was written for this and dropped. It passes both starvation
 * tests on its own, which is the problem: with it in place `flagsTruncated` implies something was
 * accepted, so the seed can never be reached and cannot be watched fail. The residual it would
 * have covered (a folder starved on EVERY cycle makes no progress, though it loses none) is
 * stated at the fix.
