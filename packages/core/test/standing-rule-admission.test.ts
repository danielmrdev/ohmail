/**
 * ═══ A RULE YOU WROTE APPLIES TO THE MAIL THAT ARRIVES AFTER IT ════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT, MEASURED AT THIS LANE'S BASE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A sender carrying an enabled rule with a SUBJECT or BODY term had every message of theirs the
 * term did not name held at the consent gate. Meanwhile both consent surfaces read that sender as
 * DECIDED — `packages/services/src/consent-cutline.ts`' `decided_sender`/`decided_domain` CTEs
 * and the client's `consent-cutline.ts#consentIndex`, whose own comment is "terms narrow
 * placement, never admission. Never add a term check here." So one message was presented in the
 * Ohbox by the rule's projection and listed behind a Screener waiting row by the gate, at the
 * same time. Driven through the real pipeline in `packages/services/test/ruled-sender-one-list.pg.test.ts`,
 * the base answered `desired_folder = 'ohmail/Screener'`, one waiting row, and
 * `cutlineCounts` `decidedSenders: 1, activeUndecidedSenders: 0` — the two ends, one account,
 * two answers.
 *
 * Two implementations of one question is what produced it. {@link standingRule} is the routing
 * side of the predicate those two already spell, and {@link namesAuthor} is now the one place the
 * sender/domain claim is written.
 *
 * ── THE TWO ARMS, AND WHY THEY DIFFER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An ADMISSION admits and does not PLACE. The standing arm is reached ONLY when a term did not
 * match — a rule with no term always claims the message and never gets here — so filing to that
 * rule's destination would make the term inert for everything else that sender writes, which is
 * the one thing terms exist to prevent. The admitted message takes the ordinary post-gate path.
 *
 * A DENIAL is carried out, above `auth` and above everything, as every denial in this function
 * is: a sender the person said no to is never re-admitted, and the destination is the one the
 * person named.
 *
 * ── MUTATIONS WATCHED (each applied, watched RED, restored, `cmp`-proven identical) ────────
 *
 * Named at the case each one reddens; the run counts are in `changes/fix-018-ruled-senders-applied-after.md`.
