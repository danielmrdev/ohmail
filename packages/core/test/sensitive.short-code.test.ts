/**
 * **SEC3-PRIV-3 — THE SHORT ONE-TIME CODE, which survived `redactForModel` in ten shapes.**
 *
 * An earlier change was believed to close a finding by blanking base64 runs of sixteen characters or more.
 * A six-digit code base64-encoded is EIGHT characters, and its docblock's safety argument —
 * *"nothing the screen can see is left unredacted"* — assumed the screen had fired BECAUSE of the
 * encoded run. It fires on the subject's vocabulary, and then the redactor is handed a snippet
 * carrying the value in a form no pass reaches.
 *
 * ── HOW THIS FILE IS BUILT, AND WHY IT IS BUILT THAT WAY ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * TWO corpora, and the second is not decoration. A detector that catches every OTP is trivially
 * satisfiable — blank everything — and the resulting product would be one that hands a model a
 * page of `[REDACTED]` and asks it to route the sender. So every catch here is paired with a
 * false-positive corpus, and that corpus has two halves:
 *
 *  · **UNFLAGGED commerce mail** — order numbers, tracking numbers, invoice references, flight
 *    records, promo codes. These must be BYTE-IDENTICAL, which pins the outer condition: the
 *    redactor does not run at all unless {@link screenOutboundText} flagged the payload.
 *  · **FLAGGED authentication mail whose PROSE must survive** — and this is the half that
 *    actually exercises the new passes, because it is the only place they run. `Your code is
 *    ready`, `Ihr Code ist nicht mehr gültig`, `New sign-in from Chrome on macOS in Zurich`. Each
 *    of those puts a short word in exactly the position a code occupies, and each of them is a
 *    word this product is being paid to let the model read.
 *
 * Every case in both corpora asserts the SCREEN's verdict first. Without that, a false-positive
 * case passes by not being flagged and a catch case is unreachable — the two most likely ways for
 * this file to become decorative.
