/**
 * A SECOND TERM ON A SENDER RULE — `rules.subject_contains` (mail 0050), in the evaluator.
 *
 * The case this exists for, stated as a person would: one sender sends the invoice AND
 * the nightly `[NinjaFirewall]` alert. Before this the account had one lever for that address — all
 * of it to Reads, or all of it to the Ohbox — so filing the alerts out filed the invoices with
 * them. The requirement is a rule that says BOTH things at once, and a bare sender rule beside it
 * that keeps everything else where it was.
 *
 * ── WHAT WOULD MAKE A GREEN RUN HERE WORTHLESS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three ways, and each has a test written against it rather than around it:
 *
 *  1. **A term that is never consulted.** Every "the narrow rule fired" assertion would pass
 *     identically if `subject_contains` were ignored, because the narrow rule ALSO matches the
 *     sender. So the load-bearing assertion is the NEGATIVE one — the sender's other mail must NOT
 *     go where the narrow rule points — and it is asserted in the same test as the positive one,
 *     from one rule set, so neither can be green on its own.
 *  2. **A term that is consulted but never DECIDES.** Two `manual` sender rules for one address at
 *     one priority tie all the way down to a UUID comparison, so a specificity clause that does
 *     nothing is invisible half the time. `outrankingIsNotAnIdCoinToss` pins the ids so ascending
 *     id order is the OPPOSITE of what the subject rank wants — the trick `rules.pg.test.ts` uses
 *     for provenance, for the same reason it had to.
 *  3. **Absence read as a term.** `null`, `""` and `"   "` must all mean "no term". A
 *     whitespace-only term read literally passes on nearly every subject, which looks like the
 *     column working right up to the day somebody clears the field.
 *
 * Each case below was mutated and watched go red; the mutations are named at the test that catches
 * them.
