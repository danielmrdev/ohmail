/**

 * words on the way out: measured on a live Screener, many bought suggestions — Receipts,
 * the News pile (`ohmail/Reads` at the time of the measurement) and Quarantine — all rendered
 * as the single word "Screened out", and three reported defects were one. These cases pin the
 * repair: `destination` and `spam` travel beside `decision`, unreduced, on BOTH the fresh
 * purchase and the stored read; `decision` keeps its three values on purpose — bulk controls
 * consume it, so widening it would widen what one press can do.
