 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE MODEL SAID "HOLD THIS AT THE GATE" AND THE SCREENER SHOWED "OHBOX 0.92"
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## The case, from production
 *
 * An account whose Ohbox bar reads *"Keep my Ohbox for real people writing to me (not any cold
 * mail advertisers wanting to sell a service)"* bought a suggestion for a first-contact sender
 * pitching accounting services. The stored `routing_decisions` row is quoted verbatim in
 * {@link REPORTED} below. The model was RIGHT: `destination = 'ohmail/Screener'`, and a rationale
 * that says so in words. The surface rendered **"AI suggests Ohbox 0.92"**.
 *
 * ## What was actually broken — not the model, not the schema, the COLLAPSE
 *
 * `screener-service.ts` turned the classifier's six-valued `Destination` into the Screener's
 * yes/no with a DENYLIST: spam, `ohmail/Screened` and `ohmail/Quarantine` were "no", and
 * everything else — by falling off the end of the function — was "yes, admit to the Ohbox".
 * `ohmail/Screener` was not on that list.
 *
 * That is not an edge case. The taxonomy DEFINES `ohmail/Screener` as the answer for a
 * first-contact sender, and every row this service reasons about is a first-contact sender, so
 * it is the MODAL answer. Measured on the hosted service the day this was written: **a large share of stored
 * suggestions, the largest single bucket, at a middling average confidence** — every one of them
 * the model asking for a human, every one of them rendering as "Ohbox" with the hold-this
 * rationale printed underneath it. With "Apply all" pressed, that is a consent gate granting
 * consent in bulk and writing an allow rule per sender.
 *
 * ## Why these tests are shaped the way they are
 *
 * A denylist is the wrong shape for a question whose safe answer is "don't act", so the fix is
 * an exhaustive `Record<Destination, …>` and the first guard below is TOTALITY: every label the
 * model is allowed to emit is driven through the real `suggest()` and must produce a decision
 * that is not an accident. Add a folder to the union and that map stops compiling; add one and
 * lie about it, and this goes red.

 * ═══ WHAT IS LEFT, FROM THE LEDGER — AND THE THREE WAYS TO GET IT WRONG ══════════════════════
 *
 * A run tells the person what it cost. The next question is what they have left, and the client
 * is categorically not allowed to work it out: subtracting `charged` from a remembered figure is
 * a second ledger, wrong after a renewal, a refund, an expiry, or a second tab — and wrong
 * upward, which is the direction that promises a purchase the account cannot make. Invariant
 * #10: the side that moves the money is the side that names it.
 *
 * So the number comes from `credit_balances`, through the injected `remaining` reader, and:
 *
 *  · it is read AFTER the loop, so it describes the account the run left behind;
 *  · it is ABSENT — never `0` — on a deployment that supplies no reader, because zero is a real
 *    balance with a real sentence and an unmetered install has neither;
 *  · a reader that THROWS is also absent. The suggestions are already bought and paid for; a
 *    courtesy read failing must not turn a successful purchase into an error, and must not
 *    report an empty balance to a funded account.
 *
 * MUTATIONS WATCHED: reading the balance BEFORE the loop turns "after the spend" red with the
 * opening figure; `remainingCredits: remainingCredits ?? 0` turns "absent, not zero" red;
 * removing the try/catch turns "a failed read is silence" red with the thrown error.
