/**
 * ═══ A FILING DECISION DID NOT RING THE WORKER'S DOORBELL ════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The reported wait, measured at its cause. The API never opens IMAP: a press writes
 * `folder_state` and returns, and the worker performs the move. What decides HOW LONG that takes
 * is the rotation — a 60 s tick queues one serialized pass, each mailbox gets one bounded turn in
 * it, and `reconcileFolders` runs on that turn. One pending move therefore waits the rest of the
 * running pass plus its own turn, which is minutes.
 *
 * `mailboxes.sync_requested_at` (mail 0049) is the lever that skips that wait: the worker's ~3 s
 * kick scan notices the stamp and serves the mailbox one ordinary bounded turn out of rotation.
 * Folder operations wrote it, a send wrote it, the pull verb wrote it, the Not-junk rescue wrote
 * it — and the move door, the most common write in the product, did not. It was the one user
 * action whose result waited for a rotation.
 *
 * ── MUTATIONS WATCHED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  · remove the call from `move` ⇒ "a move rings it" red at `null`;
 *  · drop the age predicate ⇒ "a young stamp is left standing" red (the second decision moves a
 *    stamp that is already being answered, i.e. one worker visit per press);
 *  · drop `isNull` from the predicate ⇒ "a move rings it" red — the mailbox that has never been
 *    rung is the one mailbox an instant comparison alone cannot ring;
 *  · drop the `disabled` narrowing ⇒ "a disabled mailbox is not rung" red.
