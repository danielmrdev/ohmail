/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A CONFIRMED RUN COSTS NO MORE THAN THE FIGURE SOMEBODY PRESSED
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The question the row carried for three months: is a confirmed Screener run bounded by the
 * credits the quote DISPLAYED, or only by the batch maximum? Ruled 2026-09-22: **by the quote**,
 * with `MAX_SUGGEST_SENDERS` as the second and lower bound.
 *
 * It matters because the quote and the confirm are two requests. The set is the same — the confirm
 * passes the addresses the quote priced — but the PRICE is not: a sender with a stored suggestion
 * is not priced, and a stored suggestion can lapse in between. So a set quoted at "3 senders · 3
 * credits" can cost 5 by the time somebody presses, and nothing in the request said otherwise.
 * A quote is a claim and claims are contracts.
 *
 * Every case below drives the real `suggest()` and reads what the RUN did — `charged`, the
 * suggestions it produced, the senders it refused — never a flag it was handed.
