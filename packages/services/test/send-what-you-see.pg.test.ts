/**
 * THE OTHER WINDOW'S WRITE UNDER A REAL ROW LOCK — the interleaving PGlite cannot run.
 *
 * The defect is a race: the second window's autosave commits between this press's final save and
 * its send. The check that closes it reads the draft `FOR UPDATE` inside the reserve transaction,
 * so what it must be watched doing is reading what the OTHER writer committed while it waited —
 * not a value the same connection wrote a moment earlier. PGlite is one connection and nothing
 * can hold a lock against anything, so the ordering this file asserts is unreachable there.
 *
 * The second case is the one a timestamp revision would get wrong and this one does not: the
 * other window writes an IDENTICAL buffer back. The row moved, the message did not, and refusing
 * there would be a false alarm about a draft nobody changed.
