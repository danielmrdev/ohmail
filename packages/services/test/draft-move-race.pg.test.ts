/**
 * THE MOVABLE SENDING MAILBOX UNDER REAL CONCURRENCY — the two interleavings PGlite cannot run.
 *
 * A draft's `mailboxId` is PATCHable while the row is a draft, and the send reads the row. Those
 * two writers meet on one row, and each order has a correctness claim that only holds under a
 * genuine cross-connection lock:
 *
 *  1. RESERVE BEHIND AN UNCOMMITTED MOVE. `SendService.reserve` reads the draft `FOR UPDATE`.
 *     Without the lock this is the wrong-From race in miniature: a plain read-committed SELECT
 *     does not wait for the move's row lock — it reads the PRE-move snapshot, the envelope is
 *     built from the old mailbox, and the move then commits, so the mail leaves as identity A
 *     while the row (and every screen) says B. The lock makes reserve wait and read what the
 *     move committed. This test was watched red against the plain SELECT — the fake adapter
 *     was opened for the OLD mailbox — before `.for("update")` was added.
 *
 *  2. A MOVE BEHIND A SEND THAT WINS. `DraftsService.update` puts `status = 'draft'` in the
 *     UPDATE's own predicate, not in a prior read, precisely so that a blocked move RE-EVALUATES
 *     it after the winner commits: the row it finally locks is `sending`, zero rows match, and
 *     the move answers 409 instead of rewriting the identity of a send already reserved under
 *     the old one. A read-then-write would have checked `draft` before blocking and written
 *     anyway.
 *
 * ## Why REAL Postgres (CLAUDE.md)
 * Both cases are about what happens ACROSS a held row lock — one connection blocking another,
 * then re-reading. PGlite is a single connection; nothing can hold a lock against anything.
