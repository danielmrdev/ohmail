/**
 * A GENERATED REPLY HAS TO LEAVE AS BOTH HALVES.
 *
 * The drafter answers in prose and the outbound path only builds a `multipart/alternative` when
 * `drafts.html` is present, so an AI draft used to go out as `text/plain` while the person who
 * sent it had been editing it in a rich editor. The promotion closes that; this file is the
 * evidence, and it is deliberately end-to-end — a non-null column proves nothing about what a
 * recipient receives.
 *
 * Three properties, and each one is a different failure if it breaks:
 *
 *  1. THE HALVES AGREE. `htmlToPlainText(promoted.html) === promoted.text`, over inputs chosen to
 *     break it rather than to pass. Break this and two people reading the same message on two
 *     devices read different things — the only failure `multipart/alternative` exists to prevent.
 *  2. THE MARKUP IS A FIXED POINT OF THE SANITIZER. `sanitizeOutboundHtml(html) === html`. Break
 *     this and the promotion is producing markup outside the outbound grammar; the send-time gate
 *     would still catch it, but the stored draft and the sent bytes would then differ.
 *  3. THE MODEL'S OUTPUT IS TEXT, NOT MARKUP. A reply containing `<script>` is a reply containing
 *     the characters `<script>`. This is the one property with a security consequence: the html
 *     half is stored, re-rendered in our own reader when the Sent copy comes back, and read by
 *     whatever the recipient uses.
