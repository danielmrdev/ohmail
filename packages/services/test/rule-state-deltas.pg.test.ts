/**
 * ═══ A RULE WHOSE STATE MOVED REACHES THE CLIENT ════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Every case here asks the question a client asks and nothing else: "what changed since the
 * cursor I hold?" — `SyncService.getChanges`, the same call the webapp's mirror polls. Reading
 * the `rules` table instead would pass for every one of these writers at the base, because the
 * ROW was always right; what was missing was the announcement.
 *
 * RED AT THE BASE for the promotion, the re-enable, the lifetime-net demotion and the migration's
 * retarget — four writers that moved a rule and told nobody. GREEN AT THE BASE for the request
 * applier, which is the positive control: the same reader, the same assertion, a writer that
 * already filed. A case list where every case is red proves the READER, not the writers.
 *
 * WHY POSTGRES. These are deltas allocated inside transactions — a seq from the account's counter
 * row, appended and committed with the row it describes. `promoteOrDemote` now opens a
 * transaction of its own for exactly that reason, and PGlite's single connection cannot tell a
 * committed pair from two writes that happened to follow each other.
