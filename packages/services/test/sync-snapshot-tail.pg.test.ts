/**
 * TAGGED MAIL BELOW THE SNAPSHOT WINDOW STILL REACHES THE MIRROR.
 *
 * A tag is cross-cutting and people tag OLD mail. The bootstrap snapshot is windowed
 * ({@link SNAPSHOT_WINDOW} = 90d/5000), so on a large mailbox a tagged message older than the
 * window fell off the end of the windowed walk — and the delta could never recover it, because its
 * `message_tags` change sits below the cursor the client adopts after bootstrap. The tag rail
 * showed the tag; opening the tag showed nothing. The fix is the LABELED TAIL: once the window is
 * satisfied the drain keeps paging, restricted to messages that own a `message_tags` row.
 *
 * ── AND THE SECOND ADMISSION KEY: A PARK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A PARKED message below the window is unreachable the same way and costs more: "comes back on
 * Friday" is a promise, and its `message_states` change also sits below the post-bootstrap cursor.
 * The client held the record without the mail and titled a pile entry with a raw identifier; from
 * the other side it held the mail carrying the fact on its own row and stood it in the main list
 * wearing its "Back <day>" chip. So the tail admits a message owning a `message_states` row other
 * than `none` as well. The WINDOW is unchanged — `SNAPSHOT_WINDOW` still reads 90d/5000 — and the
 * tail stays bounded by tagged-plus-parked mail rather than by the size of the mailbox.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS CANNOT BE A PGlite TEST ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The window only CLOSES after `minRows` (5000) messages have been emitted, so nothing below it
 * exists to drop until the mailbox is genuinely large. Standing up 5000+ rows and paging them is a
 * real-Postgres exercise; PGlite would be too slow to be worth running in the suite, and the bug
 * is not about a race — it is about volume — so a small-fixture version could not exhibit it.
 *
 * ── MUTATION-WATCHED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Replacing the tail transition in `sync-service.ts#getSnapshot` (`keysetOf("tail")` → `null`, the
 * pre-fix behaviour) turns every assertion below red: 0 of the labeled messages arrive and the
 * drain stops at 5000. The park arm is watched on its own two deciding lines: `false` ANDed into
 * its EXISTS drops all 40 parked messages, and widening `ne(state, "none")` leaks all 25 released
 * rows into the tail. Convergence-under-replay is not re-proven here — tail pages are
 * `op:"create"` at `seq = asOfSeq` like every other page, so the client's older-or-equal seq guard
 * makes replay a no-op, which the apply-harness tests already pin.
