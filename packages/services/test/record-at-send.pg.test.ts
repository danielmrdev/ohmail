/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  RECORD-AT-SEND, THROUGH THE DOOR — the send path writes the row, and the worker writes nothing
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `ImapAdapter.send` SMTPs the message and then APPENDs it to the mailbox's own Sent folder, so the
 * master holds it before `SendService.send` returns. Until this slice the `messages` row was written
 * only by the sync worker's next pass over Sent — up to a poll interval later — and the user's
 * report was exactly that: *"I see my sent message now in the ohbox, but it took a minute!"*
 *
 * `SendService.projectSentCopy` now records it in a separate short transaction after the finalize.
 * This file is the guard for the four claims that make that safe, all of which span the send state
 * machine, the ingest pipeline and the persist transaction:
 *
 *  1. **The row is there before any worker cycle**, with the sent content, the append's locator, not
 *     unread, on its conversation, and announced to clients in `change_log`.
 *  2. **The worker's later observation of the same UID adds nothing** — no second row, no delta, no
 *     placement change, no audit.
 *  3. **A provider's own re-rendered Sent copy** (Exchange Online files one beside ours) converges on
 *     the same row rather than becoming a second one.
 *  4. **A failure to record does not fail the send.** The mail has already gone; a 500 for a
 *     delivered message is the worst available ending, so the fault is logged and the send answers
 *     `sent`.
 *
 * ## WHY REAL POSTGRES AND NOT PGLITE (CLAUDE.md)
 *
 * The claims are about TRANSACTION BOUNDARIES, which is the category PGlite has been green for and
 * wrong about three times in this repository. Specifically: claim 4 asserts that the projection's
 * transaction failing leaves the FINALIZE committed — a statement about two separate transactions,
 * only one of which unwound — and claims 1–3 exercise `insertMessage`'s `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
 * upsert, `setPrimaryInstance`'s three-statement vacate/update/insert against
 * `message_instances_locator_uq`, and `recordChange`'s seq allocation under the account's row lock.
 * None of those mean anything without a real MVCC engine and real constraints.
