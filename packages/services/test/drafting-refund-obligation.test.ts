 *

 * drafter's own error — so the debt existed nowhere and the client rendered `failedOpaqueEarly`,
 * whose last four words are "Nothing was charged". The charge had happened.
 *
 * TWO STATES, TWO SENTENCES, asserted apart: `credits: "returned"` when the program took the
 * reversal, `credits: "owed"` when it did not. Never one optional field — the whole point is that
 * a client must not have to guess which of the two happened to somebody's money.
