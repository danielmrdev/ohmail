/**

 *  A READER'S MOVE AND DELETE BECOME REQUESTS — `MessageService` (mail 0094)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Mail 0083 refused both outright on a mailbox another install organizes. Ruling 6 replaces the
 * dead end with a `message.move` record the holder applies. The property this file exists to hold
 * is the "Organize-in-place" invariant (organize-in-place): the record is written and NOTHING ELSE IS — no
 * `folder_state`, no tombstone, no `change_log`. A version that also wrote locally would show the
 * person a message in its destination while the machine that actually holds the mailbox knew
 * nothing about it, which is the false state the whole ruling is about.
 *
 * PGlite: every case here is one connection writing rows and reading them back. The concurrency
 * halves (the drain racing the organizer's own move on one dedup key) are `.pg.test.ts` files on
 * the real box, where a sequential test of a concurrent property cannot pass by accident.
 */
