/**
 * ═══ THE SEAM IS THE TRANSPORT, NOT THE COMPOSE SURFACE ════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Attachment bytes used to ride the send request base64-encoded, so the serverless body
 * limit was a ceiling on the FEATURE: the hosted compose surface promised 3 MB of raw bytes
 * whatever the sender's own submission server announced. Staged bytes reach this service from
 * object storage instead, and a request-body limit is not a statement about them.
 *
 * ## What each guard here is for, and the mutation it was watched against
 *
 *  · **The inline path is byte-identical.** A request carrying `attachments` and nothing else must
 *    produce exactly the send it always did, including the 3 MB refusal. Mutation: make
 *    `sendSurfaceFor` return `null` unconditionally → the inline case's oversize refusal
 *    disappears and the test goes red.
 *
 * ## WHY THE INLINE PATH IS NOT ON A SUNSET CLOCK
 *
 * It reads like a compatibility path for older desktop builds, and it is not one. Both shipping
 * clients emit it today: the browser app stages only ABOVE the inline ceiling, so every send at or
 * under 3 MB is this request, and the desktop app never stages on either door (its source does not
 * contain the wire client's staging option, asserted in that app's own suite). Update uptake is
 * therefore not the question, and it could not be answered anyway — nothing carries a client
 * version to the hosted service.
 *
 * The criterion for reopening the question, so it is not re-derived from scratch: the desktop's
 * Cloud door stages, AND the browser client stages unconditionally rather than above a threshold.
 * Until both hold, the guards below stay "must accept" and inline acceptance is load-bearing.
 *  · **The staged path assembles the REAL bytes.** Mutation: drop the `msg.attachments` merge in
 *    `send` → the adapter receives a message with no files and the assertion on the delivered
 *    bytes goes red.
 *  · **Oversize is refused SERVER-SIDE at the send, on the DECLARED total, before any download.**
 *    Mutation: delete the staged branch from `reserve`'s pre-transaction block → a 40 MB stage
 *    against a 4 MB mailbox is accepted and `fetch` is called, and two assertions go red.
 *  · **A host with no staging capability refuses staged references.** This is the standalone
 *    door's shape. Mutation: fall through instead of throwing → the send succeeds with no files.
 *  · **A missing or expired ticket ends the send.** Mutation: skip the expiry comparison → the
 *    expired case is accepted.
 *  · **A MIXED send keeps the strict surface.** Mutation: make `sendSurfaceFor` uncap whenever any
 *    id is staged → the mixed case's refusal disappears.

 * ticket id, and that choice is load-bearing rather than tidy: a re-send under a fresh key
 * RE-STAGES, minting new ids for the same files, so a manifest keyed on ids would differ for an
 * identical message and the guard would miss every send that carries an attachment — which is most

   * sends were covered by the content claim. They are not, deliberately, and the reason is measured
   * rather than argued: the claim could only identify a staged file by name, type and size, and a
   * corrected 5 MiB file keeping all three was refused as already sent, with only the original ever
   * delivered. A silently unsent correction is the worst ending this path has.
   *
   * Folding by ticket id instead would cure that and protect nothing, since a re-send under a fresh
   * key re-stages and the ids always differ. So a staged send is excluded outright — and this case
   * now asserts THAT, including the protection it costs, so the limit is written down where somebody
   * changing it will see it.
   *
   * What still guards a staged send: the client's durable key, which now hashes attachment CONTENT,
   * and the refusal of any draft not in `draft` status.
