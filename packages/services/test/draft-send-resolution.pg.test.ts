/**
 * A HELD SEND HAS A WAY OUT, AND A FINISHED ONE STOPS HOLDING THE DRAFT.
 *
 * ## What was wrong, in the order a person met it
 *
 * A send whose outcome could not be confirmed leaves `outbound_sends.status = 'unverified'` and
 * `drafts.status = 'unverified'` (`SendService.finalizeUnverified`). The Drafts row then says
 * *"Not confirmed — it may not have been delivered. It's held here; check your Sent folder."* and
 * there was no verb anywhere in the product for answering that sentence. Discard did not work
 * either: `remove` refused for ANY `outbound_sends` row, so the row could not leave by the front
 * door or the back one. Pressed five times on a live account, it stayed five times.
 *
 * The same refusal caught a case that is not ambiguous at all. `finalizeFailed` records a
 * definitively-undelivered attempt and puts the draft back to `draft` with a sentence — nothing is
 * in flight and nothing is unknown — and the delete was refused anyway, because the predicate
 * asked whether a ROW EXISTED rather than whether a send was still on record.
 *
 * ## The predicate, and the constraint underneath it
 *
 * `sendOnRecord` is now `status IN ('pending','unverified')`: an attempt whose outcome is still
 * open. A `sent` or `failed` row is a LEDGER ENTRY about the past and holds nothing.
 *
 * Narrowing the predicate alone could not admit the delete, and this file is where that was
 * measured. `outbound_sends.draft_id` was `NOT NULL … ON DELETE NO ACTION`, so the DELETE reached
 * the constraint and raised `23503` for a `failed`, `sent` and `unverified` row alike — which
 * reaches a caller as an unhandled `internal` 500. That is why the 409 existed in the first place,
 * and why the fix had to be in the schema as well as in the service: `draft_id` is nullable with
 * `ON DELETE SET NULL` (mail 0095). The reservation's identity is `(account_id,
 * idempotency_key)` — the replay gate — not the draft it was once about, so the record of the
 * attempt survives the discard of the text. That is the stated intent: the words go, the fact
 * that something was attempted does not.
 *
 * ## Why these cases and not fewer
 *
 * {@link resolve} is asserted by its EFFECT on both tables rather than by its return, because the
 * two outcomes differ in what they leave behind and a DTO-shaped assertion would pass for either.
 * `arrived` is a terminal confirmation: the ledger row becomes `sent` and the draft becomes `sent`,
 * which takes it out of the Drafts list while leaving the account's record of the send alone.
 * `not_arrived` is the opposite claim and has to leave an ORDINARY DRAFT behind — editable and
 * discardable — or the verb has not actually resolved anything.
 *
 * The ordinary delete is asserted in the same file as a POSITIVE CONTROL. Every other case here is
 * a refusal or the lifting of one, and a suite made only of refusals has no evidence it still
 * admits the thing it is supposed to admit: `sendOnRecord` returning `true` unconditionally would
 * satisfy all of them and make Drafts a one-way door.

 * draft, `pending` ledger) read the same way.
 *
 * The one thing a person may NOT answer for is a send that could still be running: marking a live
 * attempt `failed` frees the row, and the next press delivers a second copy of mail already on the
 * wire. So a `pending` attempt younger than `SEND_STALE_AFTER_MS` is refused by name.

 * And with nothing open left, the LEDGER names the state rather than the person — a recorded
 * delivery is a fact, and neither verb may overwrite one in either direction.
