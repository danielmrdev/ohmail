/**
 * ═══ ONE MESSAGE IS NEVER IN THE OHBOX AND BEHIND A WAITING ROW AT ONCE ════════════════════
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT, MEASURED AT THIS LANE'S BASE, THROUGH THE REAL PIPELINE ────────────────────
 *
 * A sender carrying an enabled rule with a subject or body term, and mail from them arriving
 * AFTER the rule was written that the term does not name: `planChange` answered
 * `desired_folder = 'ohmail/Screener'`, `GET /screener` listed one waiting row, and
 * `cutlineCounts` over the same rows answered `decidedSenders: 1, activeUndecidedSenders: 0`.
 * The client's `consentIndex` reads that sender as decided too — its own comment is "terms
 * narrow placement, never admission. Never add a term check here" — so the message was
 * presented in the rule's destination and asked about at the gate at the same time. Both rows
 * (`RULED-SENDERS-MAIL-IS-STILL-BEING-HELD-AT-THE-GATE`,
 * `GATE-HELD-MAIL-IS-IN-TWO-LISTS-ON-THE-PHONE`) are that one fact.
 *
 * The gate now consults the account's standing decision about the sender
 * (`packages/core/src/rules.ts#standingRule`), which is the routing side of the predicate the
 * two consent surfaces already spell.
 *
 * ── WHY REAL POSTGRES, AND WHY BOTH ENDS IN ONE FILE ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The claim is about two readers of ONE set of rows — the server's queue and the count beside
 * it are SQL, and the client partitions the same rows in TypeScript. Two implementations of one
 * question is what produced the defect, and neither can see the disagreement from inside. The
 * mail is INGESTED here rather than seeded: the defect is in what the pipeline DECIDES, and a
 * fixture that writes `folder_state` by hand asserts the fixture. INSERT-only under a fresh
 * `account_id`.
 *
 * ── MUTATIONS WATCHED (each applied, watched RED, restored, `cmp`-proven identical) ────────
 *
 * Named at the case each one reddens.
