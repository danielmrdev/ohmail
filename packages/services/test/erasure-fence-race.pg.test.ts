/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  THE RACE ITSELF — a write already authenticated when the Art. 17 sweep commits
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The window: the session is valid when the request starts, the sweep commits, and the request's
 * write commits afterwards — under the `accounts` row that erasure deliberately KEEPS. The
 * catalogue sweep then reports zero while the account owns rows again.
 *
 * Two arms, because the two orders fail differently and only one of them is visible to PGlite:
 *
 *  ORDERED — the sweep commits first. `withAccountTx` reads `accounts.erased_at` as its first
 *  statement, sees the stamp and refuses 410 before the writer's body runs at all.
 *
 *  CONCURRENT — the request's transaction is ALREADY OPEN, past its fence, when the sweep
 *  arrives. This is the arm the gap row names and the one PGlite cannot run: one connection
 *  serialises two awaited transactions by construction, so a fence that takes no lock passes
 *  there. On real Postgres the fence's `FOR SHARE` on the account row makes the sweep's own first
 *  statement — the exclusive `update accounts` — WAIT; the writer commits its row inside the
 *  sweep's reach, and the sweep then deletes it with everything else.
 *
 * MUTATIONS WATCHED RED, THEN RESTORED:
 *  · the fence removed from `withAccountTx` → all three cases red: the writers accept the write
 *    on an erased account, and the sweep no longer waits for the open request. The gap row's
 *    defect, reproduced;
 *  · `{ mode: "share" }` dropped from `readAccountErasedAt` so the fence reads without locking →
 *    ORDERED still GREEN, CONCURRENT red on "the sweep did not wait". That split is the reason
 *    both arms are here and the reason this file is `.pg.test.ts`: the ordered arm alone would
 *    have passed a fence that reads and locks nothing;
 *  · `lock: "update"` dropped from the third case's door → 40P01 in the first round, reported by
 *    Postgres as two backends `locking tuple … in relation "accounts" … for update`. That is the
 *    regression a fence in front of the allowance gate introduces, which is why the door lets a
 *    caller name the strength it will need.
