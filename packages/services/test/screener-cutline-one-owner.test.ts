/**
 * ═══ ONE CUTLINE, ONE OWNER, THREE READERS ════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GET /consent` counted the WAITING senders through the cutline while `GET /screener` listed
 * every sender whose mail sits in the Screener folder. On a mailbox with years of history those
 * are different questions by an order of magnitude, and the queue answered the wrong one: it
 * offered first-contact senders whose newest mail was years old, beside a much smaller count.
 * The auto-suggest pass shared the list's blindness, so it could spend an account's credits on
 * advice about a sender no surface shows.
 *
 * The rule was spelled inside `cutlineCounts` and nowhere else. It now lives in
 * `@trafficflow/db#screener-cutline` — in `db` because the worker's pass is one of the three
 * readers and its deployment closure cannot reach `@trafficflow/services`.
 *
 * ── WHY A SOURCE CENSUS AND NOT ONLY THE BEHAVIOURAL CONTROLS ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The controls beside this file prove the three readers agree TODAY. They cannot refuse a fourth
 * reader, or a lane that re-spells the active test locally because the shared one was awkward to
 * reach — which is exactly how the split happened in the first place.
 *
 * ── MUTATIONS WATCHED (each restored, `cmp`-proven) ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  · drop the `senderIsActiveSql` call from `heldSenderPage`   ⇒ "the LIST reader" RED.
 *  · drop it from `selectCandidates`                            ⇒ "the SUGGEST reader" RED.
 *  · re-spell the unread choice inside a reader                 ⇒ "no second spelling" RED.
 *  · put a `bool_or(` back in any reader                        ⇒ "store-neutral" RED.
 *  · `max(m.date)` back in the COUNT reader                     ⇒ "one spelling of the instant" RED.
