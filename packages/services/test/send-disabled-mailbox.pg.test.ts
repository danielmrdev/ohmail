/**
 * A SEND FROM A DISABLED MAILBOX MUST FAIL VISIBLY, NEVER LOOK SENT.
 *
 * ## The ending this file exists to make unreachable
 *
 * `SendService.reserve` used to read only `mailboxes.address`, so a disabled mailbox was refused
 * only by ACCIDENT and only on one of the four paths that disable one: `MailboxService.delete`
 * deletes the credential rows, so `makeSendAdapter` refuses. That refusal happens in `send()`,
 * AFTER the reserve transaction has committed a `pending` reservation and flipped the draft to
 * `sending` — so the draft can never be sent again under a new key, a same-key retry answers
 * `in_flight`, and once the row goes stale the recovery path writes `unverified`, whose user-
 * facing text is *"Check your Sent folder before retrying."* For a message that never left.
 *
 * The other three paths (`disableExcessMailboxes` on a billing downgrade, `markMailboxStoodDown`
 * for the organizer lease, and a plain `PATCH {status:'disabled'}`) leave the credentials in
 * place, so there was no accident at all: the mail was genuinely sent.
 *
 * ## Why REAL Postgres and not PGlite (CLAUDE.md)
 *
 * The property is not "reserve returns an error" — it is that the reservation's INSERT is
 * **rolled back**. The check sits with the other new-reservation preconditions, i.e. AFTER the
 * `outbound_sends` INSERT has already executed inside the transaction, so what is under test is
 * whether the throw actually unwinds a real write. `notFreedKey` below is the sharp end of it:
 * after the refusal the idempotency key must still be FREE, which is only true if the row is
 * genuinely gone rather than merely unreferenced. The concurrency test additionally needs two
 * independent connections and a held `FOR UPDATE` lock, which PGlite is structurally unable to
 * express (single connection, no cross-transaction blocking).
