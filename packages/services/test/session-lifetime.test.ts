/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  SESSION LIFETIMES: ROLLING, PER SURFACE, WITH NO CEILING
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Three properties, and each of them was FALSE in a way nothing failed on before this file:
 *
 *  1. **Rolling means rolling.** A 90-day refresh window under a 90-day absolute cap measured
 *     from `sessions.created_at` is not a rolling window — it is a fixed one with extra steps,
 *     and a browser used every single day was signed out on the ninetieth. The cap is now
 *     `null` on both shipped surfaces, and "the window re-issues from NOW on every rotation" is
 *     asserted rather than assumed: the tests advance the clock past the old ceiling and keep
 *     rotating.
 *  2. **The two surfaces get different windows** — 90 days for the browser, 400 for the desktop
 *     app, which rotates on every launch and is therefore signed in indefinitely in practice.
 *  3. **The DEFAULT is the short one.** This is the property with a real failure mode attached:
 *     `surfaceTtls` resolves an unstated surface to the cookie window, and if that default ever
 *     flips to `native`, every browser session silently becomes a rolling 400-day credential
 *     with nothing erroring, no test naming a surface going red, and no symptom a user could
 *     report. The pin is `surfaceTtls(cfg)` with NO second argument.
 *
 * ── HOW THESE WERE PROVEN TO BITE (each mutation run, watched red, restored) ───────────────
 *
 *   · `surfaceTtls`'s default `= "cookie"` → `= "native"`     ⇒ "an unstated surface", "a cookie
 *                                                               rotation never issues the native
 *                                                               window"
 *   · `establish`'s `o.kind === "macos"` → `o.kind !== "macos"` ⇒ "login mints the cookie window",
 *                                                               "the desktop's own door mints
 *                                                               the native window"
 *   · `mintRotation` reading `this.cfg.refreshTtlMs` again instead of the passed `ttls`
 *                                                             ⇒ "the native surface rolls 400 days"
 *   · `rotateRefresh`'s `ttls.absoluteTtlMs != null` guard removed (treat null as 0)
 *                                                             ⇒ "no ceiling binds a session that
 *                                                               keeps being used"
 *   · the same guard inverted to skip the cap entirely        ⇒ "a ceiling a deployment DOES set"

/**
 * A movable clock ANCHORED TO REAL TIME, and the anchor is load-bearing rather than tidy.
 *
 * The absolute ceiling is measured as `ctx.now() - sessions.created_at`, and those two clocks are
 * not the same clock: every TTL in the service comes from `ctx.now()`, while `created_at` is a
 * column default filled in by the DATABASE. A fixed literal start (the constant the older auth
 * suites use sits a couple of weeks in the past) therefore makes the cap UNTESTABLE — the row is
 * stamped "now", the service thinks it is a fortnight earlier, and the age of the session comes
 * out negative however far the fake clock is advanced. The two ceiling tests below were green
 * against a cap that never fired until this was anchored.
