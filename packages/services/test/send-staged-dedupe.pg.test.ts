/**
 * SEC3-NEW-3 — ONE STAGED TICKET IS ONE DOWNLOAD, AGAINST THE REAL TABLE.
 *
 * ## The ending this file makes unreachable
 *
 * An email-verified account stages one attachment declared as ONE BYTE, then sends a draft naming
 * that single valid ticket as many times as the request body has room for. The declared total is
 * summed from the ticket, and the ticket declares one byte, so the repeats stayed far below the
 * attachment-byte cap however long the list got; resolution then walked the request array with
 * `await storage.download()` inside the loop and pulled the same object once per occurrence. One
 * authenticated request, an amplification factor equal to the array length — and a delivered
 * message carrying the same file that many times.
 *
 * The route now also refuses a list longer than `SEND_MAX_ATTACHMENT_PARTS`, so the shape that
 * survives to reach this service is a repeat list INSIDE that ceiling — which is what these tests
 * use. The dedupe is what has to hold for it, and it is the same defect at 50 repeats as at
 * many more.
 *
 * ## Why REAL Postgres and not PGlite (CLAUDE.md)
 *
 * The claim is not "the resolver returns one attachment" — that is settled in
 * `attachment-staging-store.test.ts` against an injected port, with no database anywhere. What is
 * under test HERE is the same property with the real seam underneath it, and the two things PGlite
 * cannot speak to:
 *
 *  · `readStagingTickets` issues a genuine `WHERE id IN (…)` against `attachment_staging`, so the
 *    ticket that reaches the resolver is a row Postgres returned rather than one a fake supplied.
 *    The declared size the cap is enforced against is read from that row, not asserted by a stub.
 *  · the send has to COMMIT. The dedupe happens on both sides of the reserve transaction — the
 *    declared total before it, the download after it — and the assertion that the reservation ends
 *    `sent` with one attachment on the wire is a claim about a transaction that really ran.
 *
 * ## The mutations watched, and the one result worth writing down
 *
 * The DOWNLOAD side is deduplicated at two layers — `SendService.send` before it calls the port,
 * and `resolveStagedAttachments` inside it — and **neither mutation alone turns this file red**.
 * Restoring `input.stagedAttachmentIds ?? []` in `send` leaves the resolver collapsing the list;
 * restoring `for (const id of requestedIds)` in the resolver leaves `send` handing it a list with
 * nothing to collapse. That is what defence in depth is supposed to look like, and it is recorded
 * here because a single-layer mutation coming back GREEN reads exactly like a guard that does not
 * guard. Removing BOTH is red and unmistakable: **50 downloads for one object**, and a message
 * carrying 50 copies of a one-byte file.
 *
 * Each layer is therefore watched on its own where it is reachable alone — the resolver in
 * `attachment-staging-store.test.ts` (five downloads for one object, no database in the file), and
 * the route's own dedupe in `packages/api/test/send-attachment-bounds.test.ts`.
 *
 * The DECLARE side has only one layer and is watched here directly: restoring
 * `input.stagedAttachmentIds ?? []` in `reserve` fails the second test with
 * the refusal naming the total and the limit — a 413 for a 1 MB message.

/**
 * EVERY ACCOUNT THIS FILE CREATES, so it can take them away again.
 *
 * ── WHY A PG FIXTURE HAS TO CLEAN UP, AND WHAT IT COST NOT TO ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The :5433 Postgres is SHARED and long-lived — it is the same database every `*.pg.test.ts` in
 * the repository migrates and writes to, run after run. A fixture that leaves rows behind is not
 * merely untidy: it is a permanent change to what every other suite's database-global assertions
 * see. This one left many mailboxes carrying a real `smtp_max_size_bytes`, and
 * `packages/db/test/mailbox-smtp-max-size.pg.test.ts` asserts that NO row carries a value that
 * migration could have written. That assertion went permanently red, and its red said "mail 0055
 * backfilled the column" when what had actually happened was "another suite ran".
 *
 * The mailboxes are load-bearing to this file — `smtpMaxSizeBytes` is the only ceiling a
 * staged-only send has, so they cannot simply be left null — which makes cleanup the only fix on
 * this side. The assertion over there was narrowed to production-shaped addresses in the same
 * change, because a run killed between its last test and its `afterAll` will always leak, and a
 * guard that depends on every fixture behaving is a guard that reports other people's crashes.
