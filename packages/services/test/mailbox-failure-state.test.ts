/**
 * THE PUBLIC PATCH MAY NOT STEP AROUND THE WORKER'S FAILURE STATE MACHINE.
 *
 * Mail 0023 made `mailboxes` record WHY a mailbox failed, and put the write behind exactly two
 * functions that carry the reason with the status (`markMailboxFailed` / `markMailboxConnected`,
 * `apps/worker/src/mailboxes.ts`). `PATCH /mailboxes/:id` was not one of them and wrote `status`
 * on its own, which produced two half-truths an external `max`-effort review named:
 *
 *  1. a client could DECLARE a mailbox broken — `status='error'` with no code, rendered as
 *     `"unknown"` in the user's Settings and in the admin console's operator queue, about an
 *     outage the product never observed;
 *  2. leaving `error` did not end the episode. `error_code` / `error_detail` / `failed_at` /
 *     `retry_count` survived a reconnect INVISIBLY — `toDTO` projects them only while the row
 *     says `error` — and `markMailboxFailed` COALESCEs `failed_at`, so the next unrelated
 *     failure inherited the old start time and continued the old attempt count.
 *
 * Written against PGlite deliberately: nothing here is about concurrency (the fencing half of
 * this slice is in `apps/worker/test/mailbox-fence.pg.test.ts`, on real Postgres). It is about
 * which columns one statement writes.

     ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

     `sync_blocked_reason` is the worker's report that it is NOT SERVING a mailbox whose `status`
     is `connected` — an unreadable organizer lease, credentials not yet provisioned, this
     deployment's mailbox cap. Four sites write it, and this file owns the one that is a service.

     The projection assertion below is the one that is easy to get backwards. The four failure
     columns are gated on `status === 'error'`, and applying that rule here would make these two
     fields permanently NULL on the wire — because every state they describe happens while the
     status is `connected`. That is not an inconsistency to be tidied; it is the reason the column
     exists, and a "fix" for the asymmetry would restore the 32-minute silence of 2026-08-03. */
