/**
 * THE ATTACHMENT CEILING IS THE SMALLER OF TWO NUMBERS, AND NEITHER IS A CONSTANT.
 *
 * Until this slice there was one: 3 MB, reasoned from the hosted API's serverless request-body
 * limit and base64's inflation. That reasoning is sound about one deployment and
 * describes nothing else, and it was wrong in BOTH directions at once:
 *
 *  · TOO STRICT for the local engine, which runs this same `SendService` in the same process as
 *    its own SMTP dial. There is no request body anywhere between the compose form and the wire,
 *    so the desktop was refusing attachments the user's own mail server would have taken.
 *  · TOO LOOSE for anyone whose provider caps submission below it. The product accepted the send,
 *    spent the user's wait on it, and let their own server bounce it.
 *
 * So the cap is now `min(what this host can carry, what this mailbox's server announced)`, and the
 * second half comes from the connect-time SMTP probe's own EHLO (`mailboxes.smtp_max_size_bytes`,
 * mail 0055). The stingy-provider case below is the acceptance check for this slice — not the
 * generous-provider one, which is merely the feature working.
