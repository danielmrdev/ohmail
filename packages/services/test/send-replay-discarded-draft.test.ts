/**
 * ═══ REPLAYING A KEY WHOSE MESSAGE WAS DISCARDED ═════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── THE STATE THIS IS ABOUT, AND WHY IT IS NEW ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `outbound_sends.draft_id` is nullable `ON DELETE SET NULL` since mail 0095, so that a person
 * can discard a draft whose send is definitively over while the record of the attempt survives.
 * A terminal reservation with no draft is therefore a state the database can now hold, and
 * `resumeExisting` — the same-key replay branch — is the one reader that meets it.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ANSWER IS A NAMED REFUSAL AND NOT A `draftId` ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The replay row is found by `(account_id, idempotency_key)` ALONE. The caller's draft id is a
 * separate argument, so the reservation here need not be about the message the caller is
 * holding — which is what makes the obvious answers wrong rather than merely untidy:
 *
 *  · answering with the CALLER's `draftId` tells the client that the draft it currently has
 *    open was already sent. That is a false statement about somebody's mail, on the surface
 *    they are looking at, and the composer would unlock a message that never left.
 *  · widening `SendState.draftId` to `string | null` pushes the same question into a client
 *    that has no branch for it, for a sequence a live client cannot produce: the durable send
 *    key is released on EVERY terminal outcome, so the next press mints a fresh one.
 *
 * So reaching this arm means a STALE client is replaying a key for a message that no longer
 * exists, and the honest answer is to say so and let it start a new send. The adapter maps the
 * code to a terminal rollback by inheritance rather than by a new branch: a 409 carrying an
 * `error.code` is not retryable, so `dispatch` rolls the overlay back instead of replaying the
 * refusal under the same key for ever.
 *
 * ── THE SHAPE OF THESE CASES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The reservation is SEEDED rather than produced by a real failing send, deliberately: what is
 * under test is how the replay branch reads a terminal row, and seeding states the precondition
 * in one line instead of depending on which path happens to produce a `failed` row today.
 *
 * The second case is the POSITIVE CONTROL and it is the one that fails if the refusal is written
 * too widely — an ordinary same-key replay, whose draft is still there, must keep answering
 * exactly what it answered before this existed.
