/**
 * ═══ THE ACCOUNT REPORT IS COMMIT-SIDE ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `ServiceContext.noteCredentialAccount` labels the response with the account a credential
 * resolved to, and the seams that call it (`establish`, `mintRotation`, `establishEnrollment`)
 * run inside transactions. Reporting straight through was a mutation of REQUEST state made before
 * the transaction that justified it had committed.
 *
 * That is not theoretical. The lost-rotation recovery arm wraps `mintRotation` in a transaction
 * and converts a failure to `null`, then answers an error — so a rolled-back mint left the
 * response carrying `X-Ohmail-Account` for a session that had just been rolled back. The header's
 * own comment claimed the opposite, which made the comment the false thing rather than the code.
 *
 * `inTransaction` now buffers a report made inside it and forwards it only after `transaction()`
 * resolves. This file tests that boundary DIRECTLY rather than through a route, because the
 * alternative is forcing a Postgres commit to fail — which no fixture here can do reliably, and a
 * test that cannot make the bad thing happen is not evidence. A throw inside the transaction body
 * IS the rollback, and it is the shape the recovery arm actually produces.

/**
 * ═══ AND THE BUFFER MUST NOT BE BYPASSED AT THE CALL SITE ═════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The buffering above is correct and was, for one commit, unreachable on the path it exists for.
 * `inTransaction` replaces `noteCredentialAccount` on the `txCtx` it hands the callback — so a
 * report only reaches the buffer if the code inside reports through THAT context. The recovery arm
 * called `this.mintRotation(ctx, tx, …)`: the transaction's `tx` for the writes, and the OUTER
 * `ctx` for the reporting. Every write rolled back; the report went straight through.
 *
 * The tests above passed the whole time, because they drive `inTransaction` with a callback that
 * uses its `txCtx`. They proved the mechanism and never touched the call site — which is the shape
 * this repository keeps paying for: a guard that is green because it is asking a different
 * question from the one that matters.
 *
 * So this is a SOURCE assertion, and it is about pairing rather than about behaviour: inside a
 * transaction, the context you report through must be the same one whose `db` you are writing to.
 * A behavioural test cannot reach it — staging the lost-rotation recovery arm needs a commit to
 * fail mid-sequence — and a mismatch is visible in one line of text.
