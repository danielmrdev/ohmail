/**
 * **The Screener's AI is a PURCHASE, and the read path cannot make it.**
 *
 * ## What this file used to be, and what changed
 *
 * It used to prove that `list`'s per-sender model call was sensitivity-filtered and metered.
 * Both were true, and both were the wrong question: the call was on a `GET`. One page view of
 * a window of rows was a model call per row and a credit per call, on the one endpoint a client
 * re-fetches on every poll, scroll and reload — so the cost of the Screener was a function of
 * how much the user LOOKED at it, and every subject and snippet at the gate went to a third
 * party by the act of opening the page.
 *
 * Generation is now `POST /screener/suggest` over an explicit sender set, priced before it
 * runs. `list` returns what is stored.
 *
 * ## The guard that would have caught the defect
 *
 * "the read path does not call the model, with a classifier and credits wired and eligible mail
 * held" — the first test below. It fails against the code as it stood this morning, and it is
 * the reason this file still exists rather than being deleted with the behaviour it described.
 * The structural half is one level down: `ScreenerReadService` is constructed with a bag that
 * has no `classifier` and no `credits`, so the call does not compile either.
