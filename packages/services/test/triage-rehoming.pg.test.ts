/**
 * ══ THE UN-PARK RE-HOMING UNDER REAL CONCURRENCY (review round on that change) ══════════════════
 *
 * `TriageService.setState` classifies a `none` transition by the PRIOR state — did the row just
 * leave a bottom pile? — and re-homes a read row's `last_read_at` to the message's own date when
 * it did. Two review findings live exactly in the gaps PGlite cannot exercise:
 *
 *  · THE CLASSIFICATION RACE: one client PARKS while a second, stale client CLEARS. Without a
 *    lock, the clear reads `prior = none` beside the park's uncommitted insert, then wins the
 *    upsert queue — final state `none`, and the re-homing skipped even though the winning
 *    transition just emptied a pile. The fix is the message-row `FOR UPDATE` on the guard
 *    select, which serializes the classification with the sibling transition. The interleave
 *    below is DETERMINISTIC: the park's transaction is held open at a gate (drizzle commits
 *    when the callback resolves, so awaiting inside delays the COMMIT), the clear is started
 *    against the held lock, and only then is the gate released.
 *
 *  · THE LATER-WORD RULE: `resurface_done` dispatches `triage_set: none` and a deliberate
 *    `mark_seen` WITHOUT awaiting, so either may commit first. The re-homing's row predicate
 *    (`last_read_at <= prior.setAt`) is what makes the outcomes converge: a fresh deliberate
 *    stamp — newer than the pile entry — survives the clear whichever order lands. Proven here
 *    on real Postgres because the predicate is exactly the kind of fragment PGlite binds
 *    happily while postgres-js parameterizes differently (the repo's standing pg rule).
 *
 * ONE suite at a time on :5433 — the shared advisory-lock rule.
