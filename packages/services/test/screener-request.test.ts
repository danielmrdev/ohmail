 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `suggest` gates per mailbox, so a set of senders can span several, and when NONE of them can
 * take a decision it has to pick one to name. It picked twice, independently: the id latched onto
 * the first ineligible mailbox, and the holder latched onto the first NON-NULL eligibility — not
 * the same mailbox whenever the first one's eligibility read came back null, because `??=` does
 * not assign over a null and `null` is a legitimate eligibility.
 *
 * The result was a sentence about a mailbox that does not exist: one mailbox's id beside another
 * mailbox's holder, with the choice between "nobody is organizing this" and "that install is too
 * old to apply it" made from the second while pointing at the first. The person is told to go and
 * update an install that has nothing to do with the mailbox named.
