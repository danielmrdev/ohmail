/**
 * WHICH MAILBOXES A SCHEDULED-SEND PASS MAY CLAIM FOR.
 *
 * The scan is store-wide, and for the hosted clock that is exactly right: one host, one pass,
 * every due appointment in reach is its business. The standalone desktop breaks that assumption
 * the moment an install holds more than one mailbox, because two mailboxes in one store do not
 * share a ROLE. A machine can be the organizer of one and a plain reader of another at the same
 * moment, and a reader must not send an appointment — its own were closed when it was demoted,
 * and the close is explicitly best-effort, so a survivor is not a hypothetical.
 *
 * Without a narrowing, the organizer mailbox's drain would claim and deliver the READER
 * mailbox's appointment: mail leaving from an install the real organizer knows nothing about, at
 * a time nobody re-chose. Gating the whole pass on "every mailbox here organizes" avoids that and
 * introduces a second fault — it withholds the organizer's OWN appointments because an unrelated
 * mailbox was taken over — which is why the answer is a filter and not a gate.
 *
 * ── THE THREE VALUES, AND WHY `[]` IS NOT `undefined` ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `undefined` claims anything (the hosted clock and the self-host clock, byte-identical to
 * before); a list claims only those mailboxes; `[]` claims NOTHING. The last is the one worth a
 * test of its own: it is the "absent config selects the dangerous branch" shape, and collapsing
 * it into the first with a truthiness check would make an install with no organizer runtime
 * behave like the hosted clock and send every appointment in the store.
 *
 * Mutation-checked, watched red and restored: delete the `mailboxIds` predicate from the paged
 * scan in `schedule-send-pass.ts` and the first two tests go red — the reader's appointment is
 * claimed and delivered.
