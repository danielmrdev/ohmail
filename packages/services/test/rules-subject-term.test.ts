/**
 * THE SECOND TERM ON A SENDER RULE, AT THE SERVICE BOUNDARY — mail 0050.
 *
 * `rules.subject_contains` lets one sender be split by subject: `info@` sends the invoice AND the
 * nightly `[NinjaFirewall]` alert, and a one-term rule files them together.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE IS ACTUALLY GUARDING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not the matching — that is `packages/core/test/rules-subject{,.pg}.test.ts`. This is the
 * BOUNDARY, and there is exactly one shape that must never get through it: a term that is present
 * but BLANK.
 *
 * `""` is a substring of every string, so a blank term stored literally is a rule that matches
 * EVERY subject while its row reads as specific — and because a subject-carrying rule OUTRANKS a
 * bare one (`compareRules`' specificity clause), such a row would beat the user's real rule for that
 * sender and then file all of their mail. The migration's CHECK refuses it, and so must this: a
 * constraint violation surfacing as a 500 is not a validated request, and the two layers agreeing is
 * what makes "no term" have one representation.
 *
 * The tempting alternative — coerce a blank to `null` and create a BARE rule — is refused, and the
 * reason is worth stating because it is not the dangerous-looking option. It produces a rule that is
 * safe (the pre-column behaviour) and WRONG: the subject sheet says "file just the ones whose subject
 * matches", so the account would silently get a rule covering all of that sender's mail. Refusing is
 * the only answer that cannot surprise anybody. An explicit `null` remains the way to say "no term",
 * so nothing legitimate becomes unreachable — which the clear-the-term case below asserts.
