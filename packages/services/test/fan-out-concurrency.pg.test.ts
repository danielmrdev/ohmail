/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  THE FAN-OUT UNDER CONCURRENCY — real Postgres, two live connections
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * One rule edit becomes a local write plus one request per held mailbox. Both properties below are
 * about what happens when two of those run AT THE SAME TIME, and neither can be expressed on
 * PGlite: it is single-connection, so two awaited calls there are sequential by construction and a
 * sequential test of a concurrent property cannot fail.
 *
 *  1. EXACTLY ONE REQUEST PER (EDIT, MAILBOX). The loop that writes them reads its plan from a
 *     snapshot; two interleaved transactions must not produce a mailbox with two rows from one
 *     edit, nor a mailbox silently skipped. `organizer_requests` has no unique index over
 *     `(mailbox_id, kind, payload)` — two identical rules are a legal thing to ask for — so
 *     nothing in the schema would catch a double write. The count is the only witness.
 *
 *  2. ALL OR NOTHING. The local row and its requests are one decision. A transaction that fails
 *     after writing some of them must leave NONE — otherwise a person's rule exists on one machine
 *     and is queued for a second while the third was dropped, and no surface would ever say so.
