/**
 * DELETING A DRAFT A SEND IS RESERVING — the two interleavings PGlite cannot run.
 *
 * `DraftsService.remove` used to answer 500 for a row with a send on record: the DELETE hit
 * `outbound_sends.draft_id`'s foreign key and the constraint violation reached the client as an
 * unhandled fault. It answers a named 409 now (`send_recorded`), and the sentence it carries says
 * the message stays in Drafts BECAUSE it has a send on record — which is the true reason and also
 * the only thing a person can act on.
 *
 * ## WHY THE READ IS `FOR UPDATE` AND NOT A PLAIN SELECT — the half PGlite cannot judge
 *
 * A check that merely READ `outbound_sends` would answer about the past. `SendService.reserve`
 * inserts its reservation in ANOTHER transaction, and that INSERT takes a `FOR KEY SHARE` on this
 * drafts row for the foreign key. So a reserve committing between the read and the DELETE loses
 * the draft: the read saw no reservation and the DELETE ran anyway. Since mail 0095 the key is
 * `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so that ending is no longer a 500 — it is a SILENT delete that leaves the
 * reservation naming no draft, which is worse.
 *
 * `FOR UPDATE` is the one row-lock mode that conflicts with `FOR KEY SHARE`. Taking it here
 * serializes the two, and the serialization is the whole claim:
 *
 *  1. RESERVE FIRST. The delete's locked read WAITS for the reserve, then sees the reservation and
 *     answers 409. It never reaches the DELETE, so the foreign key is never the messenger.
 *  2. DELETE FIRST. The reserve's own locked read finds no draft and answers 404.
 *
 * Neither ending is the constraint. Both are about one connection blocking another and then
 * RE-READING, which is exactly what PGlite — a single connection — cannot stage: nothing there can
 * hold a lock against anything, so the race window does not exist and the plain SELECT passes.
 * The API suite's PGlite cases prove the sentence and the status; this file proves the ordering.
 *
 * ## THE CONTROL THAT MAKES CASE 1 EVIDENCE, AND WHAT THE MUTATION ACTUALLY REDDENS
 *
 * `remove` HAS NOT ANSWERED while the reserving transaction is open: that proves the race was
 * staged, not the lock — the DELETE itself waits on the reservation's KEY SHARE. MEASURED
 * 2026-09-22 with `forUpdate` weakened to a plain read: that assertion stays green and the case
 * goes red on "a draft with a send on record was deleted"; the reservation's `draft_id` then reads
 * NULL, which the last assertion pins.
