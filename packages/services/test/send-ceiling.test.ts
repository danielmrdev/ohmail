/**
 * THE ATTEMPT CEILING — what a send that runs out of time answers, and what it leaves behind.
 *
 * The ceiling exists because a send is a SEQUENCE of network operations, each with its own
 * deadline and none with a deadline over the whole: a cold IMAP dial and LOGIN, a full SMTP
 * session, an APPEND of the message to Sent. Measured against the three shipped provider shapes,
 * the dial alone varies eightfold between consecutive presses on one account, so "several
 * seconds, sometimes stuck" is the ordinary behaviour of the sequence and not a fault in it.
 *
 * Every case here is about the BOUNDARY the outcome is decided on, which is the same boundary the
 * pre-SMTP window already draws — has anything been offered to a server yet:
 *
 *   before `adapter.send`   a definite non-delivery. The reservation is finalized `failed`, the
 *                           draft comes back with a sentence, and the key is spent.
 *   at or after it          an unknown fate. The reservation is left `pending` WITH ITS KEY, the
 *                           answer is `queued`, and nothing is ever resent.
 *
 * The second is the one that carries the double-send invariant, so it is asserted from both ends:
 * the row that is left, and what a same-key retry does with it.
