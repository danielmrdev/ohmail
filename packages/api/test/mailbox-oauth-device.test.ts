/**
 * THE DEVICE-CODE DOOR (cloud 0027) — the guards, each one written to fail first.
 *
 * The subject is not "the happy path works". It is the properties that make a POLLED ceremony safe,
 * and every one of them is a property the redirect flow next door does not have to have:
 *
 *  1. **THE READ DOES NOT CONSUME.** A ceremony polled N times is still live on the Nth. This is the
 *     one that would be invisible in a happy-path test: a consuming read passes the first poll and
 *     breaks the second, and the second is where the entire flow lives.
 *  2. **THE CLAIM IS SINGLE-USE.** Granted, declined and expired each spend the ceremony exactly
 *     once, so a replayed poll cannot store a second mailbox.
 *  3. **THE CADENCE IS THE SERVER'S.** An early poll is refused WITHOUT a request to Microsoft, and
 *     `slow_down` widens the stored interval CUMULATIVELY across requests. The client id is shared
 *     by every install using the public registration, so this is somebody else's server's problem
 *     if it is wrong.
 *  4. **CROSS-ACCOUNT IS REFUSED AND THE CEREMONY SURVIVES IT.** Deliberately different from the
 *     redirect flow, which burns a stolen `state`. Here the value never leaves the origin, so
 *     claiming on mismatch would hand any authenticated account a one-request way to kill another
 *     account's live ceremony.
 *  5. **THE SEAM IS SEPARATE.** No fallback from the confidential registration, in either
 *     direction, because a confidential client id fails the device grant outright.
 *  6. **THE PROVENANCE IS STORED.** The mailbox's credential records that the PUBLIC registration
 *     issued its refresh token, which is the only thing that keeps it alive past its first hour.
 *  7. **THE DEVICE CODE IS SEALED AND NEVER LEAVES.** Not in the response, not in the row in clear.
 *
 * ── THE TABLE UNDER TEST IS `selfHostRoutes`, NOT `apiRoutes` ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * These two routes are mounted only by the self-host composition. That is a deliberate absence from
 * the hosted table (asserted below), and it also means the frozen route census over the hosted table
 * cannot see them — so their cost class is asserted here, explicitly, rather than being an
 * arithmetic consequence somewhere else.
