/**
 * THE DESKTOP HANDOFF, AGAINST REAL POSTGRES — the two claims PGlite structurally cannot judge.
 *
 *  1. **SINGLE-USE UNDER CONCURRENCY.** `claimDesktopLink` burns the code with ONE
 *     `UPDATE … WHERE consumed_at IS NULL … RETURNING`, so the row lock decides the race and
 *     exactly one caller gets a session. The defect this shape exists to prevent —
 *     SELECT, check `consumed_at`, then UPDATE — passes every sequential test ever written and
 *     hands N simultaneous presentations N sessions. PGlite is a single connection and can
 *     never interleave two claims, so the sequential guard in `desktop-link.test.ts` is
 *     necessary and is not this. `consumeEmailVerification` was fixed for the identical reason
 *     and has the identical guard in `mail-concurrency.pg.test.ts`.
 *
 *     Twelve simultaneous claims, from SEPARATE CONNECTIONS — one `Promise.all` over one
 *     connection would serialize in the driver and prove nothing.
 *
 *  2. **HASH AT REST.** Asserted by scanning `login_tokens` for the code's plaintext with a
 *     query the database evaluates, over every column that could hold it, rather than by
 *     reading one field the test already knows the name of. A future column that started
 *     carrying the raw value would pass a field-by-field check written today.
 *
 * `describe.skipIf` on a missing Postgres, and `TF_REQUIRE_PG=1` (i.e. `pnpm test:pg`) makes
 * `realPgAvailable()` throw instead — so CI cannot silently skip this file.
