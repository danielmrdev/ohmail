/**
 * ═══ DEVICE PAIRING ON THE HOSTED TABLE — the managed door, driven as `apps/api-vercel`
 *     composes it ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The managed mount put the whole pairing ceremony on `apiRoutes` so the webapp's Devices pane
 * can mint a QR and a phone can redeem `${origin}/pair#<token>` for a bearer pair. This file
 * proves the two properties that make that mount safe on a LIVE, cookie-serving, billing-funneled
 * deployment — the properties `pair.test.ts` (self-host table) and `desktop-host.test.ts` (the
 * desktop door) each prove for THEIR compositions:
 *
 *  1. **Device-pair only, in both directions, decided by the bag.** `apps/api-vercel` wires no
 *     `services.inviteRedeem`, so the invite REDEEM refuses (`pair.ts`'s port probe — the
 *     billing-funnel bypass the old not-mounting guarded against) and the invite MINT refuses
 *     symmetrically (a grant this composition cannot redeem must not be mintable on it). The
 *     `hostedDeps` shape below mirrors that bag: the full `AuthService`, NO invite bridge,
 *     cookies ALLOWED — the managed posture exactly, and the opposite of the desktop door's.
 *
 *  2. **Zero Set-Cookie across the pairing surface, WITH the cookie surface ON.** The desktop
 *     door pins zero-Set-Cookie by composing `allowCookieAuth: false`; this table cannot — the
 *     browser client's whole session lives in cookies — so the pin has to hold per-surface: no
 *     `/pair*` response, on any status, ever carries a `Set-Cookie`, even when the REQUEST
 *     carries one. A cookie minted by the redeem would turn a token shown on a screen into a
 *     browser session on ohmail.app; a cookie minted by the mint/list/revoke would be a session
 *     write on a surface that only hands out bearer material. Mutation watched red: a
 *     `Set-Cookie` planted on the redeem's 200 turns the census below red by name.
 *
 * Plus the paired session's standing (no step-up inheritance — the desktop door's cases, re-run
 * against THIS table because this is the composition a phone actually reaches in production),
 * and the row-level fact the launch-revoke narrowing keys on: a paired session always carries a
 * `deviceId` (`apps/sidecar/src/identity.ts` narrows its per-launch revoke with
 * `isNull(sessions.deviceId)`; that narrowing protects sessions like the ones minted here, so
 * the NOT-NULL half is asserted where the sessions are minted).
