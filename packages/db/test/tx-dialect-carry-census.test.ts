/**
 * WHAT IS LEFT OF CARRYING THE BRAND BY HAND, pinned exactly.
 *
 * Branding a handle now wraps its `transaction`, so a callback is handed a branded object and a
 * savepoint opened on that one is branded too. The brand is INHERITED, which is what makes "a
 * handle that reaches a statement is branded" true by construction rather than by everybody
 * remembering — and remembering was the failure: nineteen requests answered 500 from one read that
 * had just started asking which store it was on, with the reason discarded by the route's handler.
 *
 * The sites below predate that and are now belt-and-braces. They are kept rather than swept because
 * each is a REPOSITORY built around a transaction, where being explicit costs nothing and reads as
 * the deliberate act it is — and they are PINNED because a NEW one appearing is the interesting
 * event: it means somebody met an unbranded transaction and stamped it by hand, which is either a
 * handle no factory branded (the seam's own refusal is the right answer) or a driver whose
 * transaction the wrapper did not reach (which this file is where to record).
 *
 * TWO OF THEM DO NOT PREDATE IT, and they are the second case that paragraph names.
 * `packages/services/src/context.ts` is the shared `runInTransaction`: it reaches
 * `db.transaction` through a structural cast, so the branded wrapper is not in that path and
 * the callback's handle arrives unbranded — this one carry is what every service opening a
 * transaction through that helper depends on, and without it a phone's statements asked the
 * server's dialect inside every transaction. `mailbox-service.ts` derives a projection context
 * around a transaction for the reason its own comment gives, one line above the call.
