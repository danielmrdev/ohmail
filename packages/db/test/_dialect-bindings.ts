/**
 * WHAT A RAW `sql` FRAGMENT BINDS — the census's third question, and the only one needing a TYPE.
 *
 * The other two tables ask what a file's SQL SAYS, and text answers that. This one asks what a
 * file's SQL BINDS, and text cannot answer it: the defect shipped as `${releaseRequested}`, a bare
 * identifier with nothing about it to grep for. What made it a defect is the identifier's TYPE.
 *
 * ── THE CLASS, MEASURED TWICE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A raw template parameter carries NO column encoder. The schema's timestamp columns are
 * `integer(… { mode: "timestamp_ms" })` on the device store, and nothing maps a `Date` onto that
 * when the value arrives through a raw fragment. `node:sqlite` binds it as SQL NULL through a bare
 * `prepare().all()` and REFUSES it through `.returning()` — `Provided value cannot be bound to
 * SQLite parameter`. So `is not distinct from` compared against NULL, matched no row, and the
 * phone went on saying it organizes a mailbox whose claim was already gone. The seam's `tsOrNull`
 * is the ported spelling, and the reason it is a member rather than a caller's ternary is that the
 * caller who would have written the ternary wrote `${at}` instead.
 *
 * ── WHY A PROGRAM AND NOT A PATTERN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two shapes the measurement found, which between them rule out every lexical reading:
 *
 *   · `${releaseRequested}` is a Date and looks like nothing. No `new Date(`, no `.toISOString()`,
 *     no name that says so — the only witness is the declaration, in another function.
 *   · `${reps.sortKey}` is `SQL.Aliased<Date>` — a drizzle alias that renders as an IDENTIFIER and
 *     binds nothing. Its type STRING contains "Date". {@link isJsDate} asks the SYMBOL instead, so
 *     the alias is outside the answer by construction rather than by an exception.
 *
 * The second reading was measured rather than argued: the same arm with the decision changed to
 * `typeToString(type).includes("Date")` reported SIXTY-SEVEN bindings where this one reports none.
 * Every one was already ported — a `PgColumn` of a column NAMED date, an `SQL<Date>` fragment the
 * seam had built, the alias. A list that names clean lines is a list its reader stops trusting.
