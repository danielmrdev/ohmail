/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  A BIG BATCH OF CHANGES IS STILL ONE BATCH — the bind-parameter ceiling
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `recordChanges` built ONE `INSERT` for however many rows it was handed. Each row binds six
 * parameters and PostgreSQL's wire protocol caps the count per statement, so past **a sixth of that in rows the
 * statement does not truncate or slow down — it errors**.
 *
 * Nothing reached it while the only callers were per-cycle batches. A MAILBOX REMOVAL did: it
 * closes every pending appointment on the mailbox inside `MailboxService.delete`'s transaction,
 * and the batch size is then a property of the account's data rather than of the code. There the
 * failure is unrecoverable rather than transient — the error propagates out of `delete`, rolls
 * back the tombstone AND the credential delete, and does so identically on every retry, so the
 * mailbox becomes impossible to remove. Raised by review against.
 *
 * ── WHY REAL POSTGRES, AND WHY THE COUNT IS PAST THE WALL AND NOT MERELY PAST A CHUNK ───────
 *
 * The ceiling is the SERVER's, enforced at bind time; a driver-level or PGlite check would be
 * testing something else.
 *
 * The count is **above that wall**, and it has to be. It was one chunk and a row for one round — one row past a
 * chunk boundary, which proves the loop runs twice and that nothing is dropped at the seam, and
 * which review correctly refused: that many rows is bind values comfortably UNDER the limit,
 * so restoring the single `values(rows)` statement left this file GREEN. A regression test that
 * stays green with the fix removed is not a guard, whatever its name says (CLAUDE.md). The count
 * now sits past the wall, so the committed test fails against the committed bug — which is the
 * only version of this file worth having.
 *
 * ── HOW TO WATCH IT FAIL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Replace the loop in `recordChanges` with the single `values(rows)` it used to be: the insert
 * errors with `MAX_PARAMETERS_EXCEEDED: Max number of parameters (65534) exceeded`, at this
 * count, with no other edit. With the loop in place, deleting the `slice` so every chunk inserts
 * the whole array reddens the uniqueness assertion on a duplicate key instead. Both were run.

 * spans three chunks of {@link CHANGE_INSERT_CHUNK}, so the seam is exercised more than once.
