/**
 * ONE PREDICATE, TWO SPENDERS — the census that keeps "could a decision here ever land" from being
 * asked in one place and forgotten in the other.
 *
 * The manual purchase route has asked it since 0.14.1. The automatic worker pass did not, so a
 * person who stopped the sole organizer kept being charged every cycle for advice nobody could
 * apply. The fix is not a second copy of the three clauses in the worker — a copy is exactly how
 * the two drifted in the first place — it is one exported function both callers call.
 *
 * ## What this holds, from both directions
 *
 *  1. both money call sites CALL `decisionCanBeApplied` (a renamed or deleted call is red);
 *  2. NEITHER re-spells its clauses inline, so a future edit cannot quietly fork the rule;
 *  3. the function itself answers the three states a mailbox can be in.
 *
 * The source is read through the repository's ONE-PASS comment stripper, because the clause this
 * census hunts for is quoted in the prose above several of these very call sites — a two-pass
 * regex strip has already eaten thousands of characters of one source file here, and a scanner that
 * silently matches nothing is green precisely when it is useless.
