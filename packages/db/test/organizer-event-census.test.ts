/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  EVERY WRITER OF THE ORGANIZING TRIPLE STAMPS WHEN IT HAPPENED (mail 0088)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The notice a person sees — *"another install organizes this mailbox now"*, *"that install
 * stopped — you can claim it"* — is DERIVED from two instants on the row: it shows iff
 * `organizer_event_at > coalesce(organizer_event_seen_at, -infinity)`. That shape is what makes it
 * appear exactly once per event on every door at once, and what makes two changes between two
 * reads collapse to the later one.
 *
 * It rests entirely on `organizer_event_at` being written by EVERY writer that changes the
 * (role, state, holder) triple. A writer that moves the role and forgets the stamp does not fail:
 * it produces a coherent row in which the mailbox has visibly changed hands and the person is
 * never told. Nothing throws, no query is wrong, and every other test stays green — which is the
 * shape of defect a census exists for and a reading cannot catch.
 *
 * ── THE FAILURE THIS IS SHAPED AGAINST IS THE WRITER NOBODY HAS ADDED YET ──────────────────
 *
 * There are eight such statements today — four on each door — and each is tested where its
 * behaviour is. What none of those
 * tests can say anything about is the SIXTH — a new roster sweep, a new backstop, a new door that
 * demotes a mailbox — and that is exactly how the original hole in this area was reached: mail
 * 0083 moved the stand-down onto `organizer_role` and left `disabled_reason` with no writer at
 * all, and five separate reads silently began answering NULL. Nothing was broken; a row that says
 * "nothing happened" is a coherent row.
 *
 * ── WHY IT MATCHES STATEMENTS AND NOT FILES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A file-level needle would be satisfied by any one statement in the file carrying the stamp, and
 * `apps/worker/src/mailboxes.ts` holds four writers of this triple. Three of them stamping is not
 * the invariant. So the unit is the `.set({…})` or `.values({…})` block, brace-matched, and every
 * block that names `organizerRole` or `organizerState` is asked the question on its own.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE EXCEPTIONS ARE AN EXACT SET ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `flag-intent-census.test.ts`'s rule, restated: a scanner that finds nothing is green, and a
 * broken scanner finds nothing. So the exceptions are enumerated and asserted as an exact set
 * rather than skipped by a predicate — a birth site that stops being one, or a sixth writer that
 * quietly joins the list, is red.

 *    a mailbox connected for the first time, which nobody has ever organized. There is no prior
 *    situation for an event to be a change from, and stamping one would put a notice in front of
 *    somebody about a mailbox they connected ten seconds ago.
 *  · `identity.ts#ensureLocalWorld` is the standalone door's version of the same INSERT.
 *
 * The MIRROR (`cloud-mirror.ts`) is deliberately NOT here: it carries both instants, because the
 * hosted row is the authority and a door that mirrored half of the pair would either re-show a
 * dismissed notice or hide a real one. It is therefore an ordinary writer as far as this census is
 * concerned, and it passes.
 *
 * A path plus a discriminator rather than a path alone, so that a file which gains a genuine

 * interpolation, which unbalanced the match and ran it to the next brace that happened to close.

 * at all, and a census that silently stops looking at a writer is exactly the vacuous green this
 * file's header refuses.
 *
 * So the scanner skips what cannot contain a real brace: `'…'`, `"…"` and backtick templates
 * (whose `${…}` interpolations ARE counted, because those are ordinary code). Still crude — it
 * does not understand regex literals — and still safe in the same direction: a mis-matched block
