/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  `away_responders.piles` IS A CLOSED SET, AND THE DATABASE IS WHAT CLOSES IT
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * mail 0096. The write path is already closed in code — the settings validator admits members of
 * `AWAY_ANSWERABLE_PILES` and 400s anything else, and the settings control offers that same
 * constant — and that argument is the one the operator console's isolation sweep cannot check. It
 * sees constraints, not validators; and the argument stops being true the moment a second write
 * path exists, with nothing failing when it does.
 *
 * What makes it worth a constraint rather than a review note is which way an unhandled member
 * fails. The pile rule refuses a member it does not know, so a stored `ohmail/Quarantine` would not
 * cause a reply — but a stored member is also what the SURFACE reads to say what the responder is
 * doing, and a scope nobody enumerated has no true sentence. The database refusing it is what keeps
 * the stored value and the stated scope the same thing.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS CANNOT BE A PGlite TEST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The constraint's whole content is what REAL Postgres does with a value outside the set, and the
 * containment operator (`<@`) over a `text[]` is the part most worth reading off a server rather
 * than assuming. A green run against a database that never applied the migration would say nothing
 * at all, so the journal is applied here.
 *
 * ── AND THE SET IS READ FROM THE CODE, NOT RETYPED ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `AWAY_ANSWERABLE_PILES` is what the validator and the settings control both use. Retyping it here
 * would let the two drift in the direction that fails silently: a third pile added to the code and
 * not to the constraint is a setting that appears to save and is refused by the database at the
 * moment somebody presses Save.
