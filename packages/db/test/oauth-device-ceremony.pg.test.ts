/**
 * CLOUD 0027 — THE DEVICE CEREMONY'S TWO DIRECTIONS, PINNED, ON REAL POSTGRES.
 *
 * The device flow adds a NON-CONSUMING read to a store whose whole security property was that a
 * ceremony is spent by the request that reads it. Both halves of that have to hold at once, and
 * PGlite can prove neither:
 *
 *  · **THE POLL MUST NOT CONSUME.** A ceremony read N times is live on the Nth. A consuming read
 *    passes a happy-path test and breaks the second poll, which is where the flow lives.
 *  · **THE CLAIM MUST STILL BE SINGLE-USE**, under real concurrency — N callers, exactly one
 *    winner — and so must the redirect flow's own consume, which this change must not weaken.
 *  · **THE POLL LEASE MUST BE ATOMIC.** `last_polled_at + interval <= now` sits in the UPDATE's own
 *    predicate so two concurrent polls serialize on the row and only one reaches Microsoft. A
 *    read-then-write version of that check has a window exactly the width of a round trip to
 *    Microsoft — which is precisely the window two browser tabs occupy — and it passes identically
 *    on a single-connection engine.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md: *"PGlite green means nothing for transactional code."* Three production bugs were
 * invisible to it. So the decisive cases run here, on :5433, over SEPARATE CONNECTIONS.
 *
 * ── AND THE REDIRECT ARM IS RE-ASSERTED IN THIS FILE, DELIBERATELY ────────────────────────
 *
 * `oauth-ceremony.pg.test.ts` already proves the redirect flow's consume-once. It is proved AGAIN at
 * the end of this file, beside the device arm, because the risk this change introduces is not that
 * either property is wrong today — it is that a later reader, holding one module with two
 * disciplines in it, makes them one. A test that shows both laws in one place is what makes that
 * diff obviously wrong instead of plausibly tidy.
