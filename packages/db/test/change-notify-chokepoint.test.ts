/**
 * EVERY `change_log` WRITER SIGNALS, because there is exactly ONE writer.
 *
 * The wake channel's whole claim is "any committed append wakes the listeners" — from the
 * worker's ingest, the API's record-at-send, the screener, triage, the sidecar's local mirror.
 * That claim is not enforced by auditing call sites; it is enforced by there BEING one site:
 * `recordChanges` in `packages/db/src/change-log.ts` is the only production code that inserts
 * into `change_log`, and the wake signal lives inside it, in the same transaction as the insert.
 *
 * This test is the half a pg test cannot be: `change-notify.pg.test.ts` proves the chokepoint
 * notifies; this proves everything IS the chokepoint. A new writer that inserts into the table
 * directly would ship mutations no push client ever hears about — mail that arrives only on the
 * safety poll — and nothing at runtime would ever say so. Route the new writer through
 * `recordChanges` (or `recordChange`); do not add it to an allowlist here.
