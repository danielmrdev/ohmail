/**
 * ═══ "HAS ANYBODY BEEN ASKED ABOUT AI?" — the question the switch cannot answer ═════════════
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT, MEASURED RATHER THAN READ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `OnboardingAi` is a four-state union because "answered no" and "never asked" select opposite
 * screens. The hosted door could supply three, and the note that said so also said `ai_enabled`
 * "rests false" — which is wrong twice over. The column is `NOT NULL DEFAULT true` (0019) and
 * `aiEnabledFor` falls back to `true` for a missing row, so a fresh account reported `on` and
 * `deriveOnboardingStep`'s AI row never fired. Driving the derivation with a fresh hosted account
 * answers `pull`: the question was not asked twice, it was never asked, on an account whose AI
 * was already spending its credits.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE IS ON REAL POSTGRES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The write is a conditional UPDATE on a column with a NOT NULL DEFAULT, and the whole point is
 * what happens when the value does NOT change. PGlite green means nothing for that class
 * (CLAUDE.md), and the interesting half — the migration's backfill touching only `ai_enabled =
 * false` rows — is a statement, not a function.
 *
 * Mutation-checked, each watched red and restored:
 *  · restore the bare `if (previous === enabled) return …` → the unchanged-value cases;
 *  · drop `aiAnsweredAt` from the changed-value UPDATE     → the switch-moved case;
 *  · `answered: row.aiAnsweredAt === null`                 → every read case.
