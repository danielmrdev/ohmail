/**
 * EVERY AI SPEND GOES THROUGH THE PORT, AND THE GATE IS ONE MODULE'S PRIVATE BUSINESS.
 *
 * The port's spend half was implemented twice and reached from nowhere: every AI spend in the
 * product still constructed `makeAiCreditGate` — four construction sites, ten call sites — and the
 * two implementations of the port had come to mean different things by `attemptKey`, which is a
 * double charge waiting for whoever swapped one for the other. A reviewer found that by reading.
 * This census is so the next one does not have to.
 *
 * TWO RULES, and they are different questions:
 *
 *  1. NOTHING in production constructs a gate, because there is no gate here to construct: the
 *     local adapter and the ledger behind it left with the metering state. The rule that used to
 *     name one permitted module now names none, which is the stronger form of the same claim.
 *  2. `sourceFor` is the ONLY place a spend namespace is joined to a key, so a source cannot be
 *     composed twice or half-composed. A module that builds one by hand is refused by name.
 *
 * SCOPE IS `src`, NOT THE TESTS, and that is deliberate rather than a gap. The gate's own suites
 * construct it directly and must: they are the proof that the ledger's five exactly-once layers
 * hold, and they are worth more than a symbolic purity that would delete them. What the rules
 * above are about is PRODUCTION reaching the gate around the port.
