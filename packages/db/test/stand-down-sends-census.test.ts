/**
 * EVERY STAND-DOWN CLOSES THE APPOINTMENTS IT ORPHANS — the structural half of
 * `QAO-SCHEDULED-SEND-ORPHANED-BY-MIGRATION`.
 *
 * The behavioural halves live where the behaviour is: the engine's gate and its launch catch-up in
 * `apps/sidecar/test/scheduled-send-stand-down.test.ts`, the mechanism and the double-send
 * boundary in `packages/services/test/scheduled-send-stand-down.pg.test.ts`. Neither can say
 * anything about a stand-down path somebody adds NEXT, and that is the whole shape of the original
 * defect: the appointment was orphaned not because a rule was broken but because a gate existed
 * that nobody had asked this question about.
 *
 * So this is a census, and the invariant it pins is one sentence: **a file that stands a mailbox
 * down must also close that mailbox's appointments.** A new organizer gate, a new roster sweep, a
 * new cron that writes `disabled` + `disabled_reason` — each of them fails here until it does.
 *
 * ── WHY EXACT-SET EQUALITY, NOT "NOTHING OUTSIDE THE ALLOWLIST" ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `flag-intent-census.test.ts`'s reason verbatim: a scanner that finds nothing is green, and a
 * broken scanner finds nothing. Asserting the found set EQUALS the allowlist means a regression in
 * the walk or in either needle goes red on the files that are known to contain them, so this
 * cannot be vacuously green.
 *
 * Scope: `packages/*\/src` and `apps/*\/src` plus `apps/*\/app` — product source only. Tests write
 * `disabled` rows to stage fixtures constantly; they are not writers of record.
 */

/**
 * A STAND-DOWN WRITE, in the two spellings that exist.
 *
 * Cloud goes through the fenced lifecycle helper; the desktop writes its own row inline, because
 * its store has no shard, no leader and therefore no fence to apply. `markMailboxStoodDown(db,`
 * and not the bare name, so the helper's own DEFINITION in `apps/worker/src/mailboxes.ts` is not
 * counted as a stand-down — it is the write, not a decision to stand down, and it has no mailbox
 * whose appointments it could close.
 *
 * ── THE SECOND NEEDLE MOVED WITH MAIL 0083, AND THE OLD ONE WOULD NOW MATCH NOTHING ─────────
 *
 * It read `status: "disabled", disabledReason: (?!null)` — the pair that WAS a stand-down while
 * the loser stopped entirely. A loser is now a READER: `organizer_role = 'reader'` plus the four
 * holder columns, with `status` untouched and `disabled_reason` gaining no writer at all. So the
 * old needle matches nothing any current build writes, and a census whose needle matches nothing
 * is vacuously green — which is the exact failure the exact-set assertion below exists to make
 * impossible, and it would have been reached silently by leaving this line alone.
 *
 * The excluded case it used to carry is now excluded BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by a lookahead.
 * `apps/sidecar/src/cloud-mirror.ts` writes `{status: "disabled", disabledReason: null}` — a
 * RETIREMENT TOMBSTONE, a mailbox the hosted account no longer names — and it does not write a
 * ROLE, because a removal demotes nothing: it retires the row. Closing appointments there would
 * be closing them on a row the same transaction is replacing, and `closeRemovedMailboxAppointments`
 * is the function that serves it, with its own precondition and its own sentence.
 *
 * ── COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED BEFORE MATCHING, AND THAT IS A STRENGTHENING ──────────────────────
 *
 * It was not, and mail 0083 found the hole the useful way: `apps/worker/src/mailboxes.ts` gained
 * a comment MENTIONING `closeStoodDownAppointments` (to say the close now keys on the role), and
 * the census read the file as a call site. The direction that matters is the other one — a file
 * whose only occurrence of the close is in PROSE would have satisfied the needle and been counted
 * as "the close is reached from here", which is a stand-down site certified by a sentence. So
 * both needle sets now run over source with comments removed.
