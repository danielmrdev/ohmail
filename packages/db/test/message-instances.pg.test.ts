/**
 * `message_instances` AGAINST REAL POSTGRES — mail 0028.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE CANNOT BE A PGlite TEST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The table's identity is `UNIQUE (message_id) WHERE is_primary` — a PARTIAL unique index, which is
 * exactly the class of object PGlite has misled this repository about before (CLAUDE.md: three
 * production bugs were invisible to it and only appeared against real Postgres). The whole model
 * rests on that predicate: without it a non-partial unique on `message_id` refuses the SECOND
 * instance the table exists to hold, and without the index at all two rows can both claim to be one
 * message's primary — so `messages.native_locator` and the instance table can disagree about where a
 * message physically is, and the adapter is then told to move a UID that belongs to something else.
 *
 * The locator unique is the other half, and its `uidvalidity` column is the part worth proving: a
 * UID number is meaningless outside the server epoch that issued it, and a folder that resets
 * commonly re-allocates from low numbers. Drop the epoch from the key and the same physical slot
 * under two epochs collides, so the new message cannot be recorded, its body is never fetched, and
 * the cursor advances past it. Permanently.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE BACKFILL IS EXECUTED FROM THE MIGRATION FILE ITSELF ──────────────────────────
 *
 * 0028 carries the only DATA statement in the whole post-split journal history. Re-typing it here
 * would test a copy; reading it out of the shipped `.sql` and running it tests the statement that
 * production runs — including its `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, which is what makes `openLocalDb`'s
 * re-run-on-every-launch survivable.
