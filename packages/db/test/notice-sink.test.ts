/**
 * EVERY PRODUCTION `postgres()` CLIENT MUST HANDLE NOTICES.
 *
 * postgres.js defaults `onnotice` to console, so a client that does not pass one writes the driver's
 * raw notice OBJECT to stdout — bypassing the hardened logger completely. Observed in the live
 * worker drain 2026-08-04:
 *
 *   { severity: 'NOTICE', code: '54000', message: 'word is too long to be indexed',
 *     detail: 'Words longer than 2047 characters are ignored.', file: 'ts_parse.c' }
 *
 * No `ts=`, no `service=`, no `event=`. An earlier change established that the drain is a CONTROLLED surface
 * precisely because hostile input can choose what lands in it; a Postgres notice can carry row
 * values (constraint text, any `RAISE NOTICE`), so this is an uncontrolled path into it. Same class
 * as that change.
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE CENSUS AND NOT A DB TEST. The defect is "a construction site forgot an option",
 * which is a property of the source, not of a session. A DB test would also have to share the one
 * Postgres behind the pg suite's global advisory lock — and it would prove nothing about the OTHER
 * construction sites, which is the whole point. This is the `staff-grants.ts` / `legacy-domains.mjs`
 * pattern.
 *
 * A NOTE THAT USED TO SAY THIS FILE'S ASSERTION DISAGREED WITH PRODUCTION. IT WAS WRONG.
 *
 * `expect(Object.keys(lines[0]!.fields).sort()).toEqual(["code", "severity"])` below passes, and for a
 * few hours I believed production contradicted it, because `railway logs`' default rendering showed
 * `code="54000"` and no `severity`. **The assertion was right.** `railway logs --json` returns
 * `"severity":"NOTICE"` — the field was always in the payload; the plain view just does not print every
 * attribute. I doubted a correct test because of a lossy reader, then spent three passes eliminating
 * build staleness and pooler stripping to explain a symptom my instrument had invented.
 *
 * The asymmetry I should have applied, and the reason it is written here: **a lossy viewer cannot show
 * content that was never emitted, but it CAN hide content that was.** So an ABSENCE observed through it
 * (zero raw notice dumps, zero driver prose — the actual privacy claim) is sound evidence, while a
 * MISSING FIELD observed through it proves nothing at all.
 *
 * The real limitation of these tests stands, and is smaller than I claimed: they inject a fake logger,
 * so they prove what the sink HANDS OVER, not what gets EMITTED. That gap caused no divergence here —
 * driving the real `createLogger` produces
 * `{"event":"pg_notice","severity":"NOTICE","code":"54000",…}` — but it is still the honest place to
 * strengthen: assert on the real logger's emitted bytes rather than on a captured `fields` object.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CENSUS DOES NOT PROVE — read this before trusting it.
 *
 * It proves a handler is PASSED. It does not prove the handler is SAFE, and two sites in the tree
 * pass handlers that forward exactly the fields `onNotice` refuses:
 *
 *   provision-staff-role.ts:85  onnotice: (n) => notices.push(`${n.severity}: ${n.message}…${n.detail}`)
 *   the Data API lockdown:191   onnotice: (n) => notices.push(`${n.severity}: ${n.message}`)
 *
 * Both are operator-run provisioning scripts collecting into a local array for terminal output, which
 * is a deliberate allow — but the census cannot distinguish that from a leak, so **"the census is
 * green" must never be read as "no site forwards notice prose."** The safety property is carried only
 * by the separate `onNotice`/`noticeSinkFor` tests below, and only for the sites that use them. If a
 * future site hand-rolls a handler that ships `message` to the DRAIN rather than a terminal, nothing
 * here fails.
 *
 * WHY THE TESTS THEMSELVES ARE EXEMPT, AND WHY THAT IS THE SHARP PART. Every pg test already passes
 * `onnotice: () => {}`. So the channel was silenced in exactly the place it is harmless and left open
 * in exactly the place it is not — which is why no test could ever have caught this, and why the
 * census has to read production source rather than trust a passing suite.
