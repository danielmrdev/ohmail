/**
 * the `mailboxes.error_code` taxonomy is defined ONCE.
 *
 * It was written out three times: the worker's union (which EMITS the values), the services DTO
 * union (which SHIPS them to the client), and a `//` comment on the column. Nothing connected
 * them. The failure that buys is quiet in both directions — the DTO promising a code the worker
 * never emits, or the worker emitting one the client cannot map to copy, so the Settings pane
 * renders a blank reason beside a red mailbox.
 *
 * The project's design notes proposed "a guard asserting the two unions match". A single definition is strictly
 * better, so the guard's job changed: it no longer compares two lists, it asserts that a second
 * list has not come BACK. A type-level union cannot be checked at runtime, so the assertion is
 * over the source text — crude, and the only thing that actually catches the regression, since
 * TypeScript is perfectly happy for two identical unions to coexist.
