/**
 * THE OUTAGE THESE PREVENT, AND IT ALREADY HAPPENED.
 *
 * 2026-08-01, production: Neon storage filled while backfilling a real mailbox.
 * A transaction that could not commit left a backend `idle in transaction` holding row locks
 * on `messages`. Every worker that restarted took the leader advisory lock, began ingesting,
 * and blocked on `transactionid` — FOREVER, because a Postgres lock wait has no default
 * ceiling. It held the advisory lock while wedged, so no standby could take over; it never
 * finished a cycle, so it never wrote a heartbeat; and `sync_lag` could not page because the
 * alert pass runs inside the worker that was dark. Two restarts and a full redeploy wedged
 * identically. The shard was down and the only evidence was an absence.
 *
 * Nothing in the application could have escaped that: it is a server-side wait, so only a
 * server-side deadline ends it. Hence three, each aimed at a different half of the deadlock —
 * and this file exists because "we set some timeouts" is a claim, and the claim is that they
 * reach a real connection.
