/**
 * THE MATRIX'S WIRING, CHECKED FROM THE RUN THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS.
 *
 * The second run proves which store it opened by comparing two environment variables. Both came
 * from a single `env` block in a single config, so deleting that block did two things at once: the
 * run became a copy of the first, and the check written to notice returned early and passed. A
 * guard whose arming and whose subject share one edit is not a guard.
 *
 * So the pairing is asserted from HERE — the default project, which runs on every `pnpm test` —
 * against the config files as text. This file cannot be disarmed by the edit it exists to catch,
 * because it does not read the environment at all.
