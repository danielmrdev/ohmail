 * ONE PREDICATE, TWO AUTOMATIC BUYERS — which held mail a model may be asked about with nobody
 * pressing. The always-on pass spelled the rule inline, and the suggest route's automatic batch did
 * not ask it at all, so a sender the pass kept out was sent by the browser's on-open batch
 * (SCREENER-NO-AI-SENDER-STILL-ASKED-ON-A-PURCHASE). Both now call `automaticAiAdmits`, neither
 * re-spells its clauses, and its SQL is pinned here; what each buyer DOES with it is measured where
 * it spends (`screener-ai.test.ts` for the route, `screener-auto-suggest.pg.test.ts` for the pass).
