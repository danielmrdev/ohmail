/**
 * TWO MODULES A DEVICE MUST NEVER REACH, AND A WALK THAT SAYS SO RATHER THAN A COMMENT.
 *
 * `packages/db/src/baseline.ts` adopts the POSTGRES migration journal — it asks
 * `information_schema.tables` whether `__drizzle_migrations` exists and stamps rows into it. A
 * device runs a different journal through a different migrator (`sqlite-migrate.ts`), so this
 * module has no work to do there and no way to do it.
 *
 * `packages/db/src/mailbox-dedup.ts` reads `information_schema.columns` and `pg_indexes` to decide
 * what shape the schema is in before a de-duplication runs. Those are Postgres catalogs. The
 * device store's catalog is `sqlite_master` and `pragma table_info`, which is not a different
 * spelling of the same query — it is a different question with different answers.
 *
 * Neither is a PORT. Both are server-only, and they are excluded from the dialect census by name
 * for that reason — which is exactly the kind of exclusion that rots. An excluded module is one
 * nobody re-reads, and the day something the phone composes grows an import of it, the census
 * that would have objected has been told not to look.
 *
 * ── SO THE EXCLUSION IS MEASURED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This walks the static import graph from the entry points a device's composition goes through
 * and asserts neither module is reachable. It is not the bundle — the device entry does not exist
 * until the engine is composed for it — and it is the strongest statement available before then,
 * because every one of these roots IS reached on a device and none of them may reach these two.
 *
 * When the device entry lands, this walk's seed becomes that entry and the assertion is unchanged.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS ALLOWED TO REACH THEM, NAMED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `migrate.ts`, `admin.ts`, `setup-prod.ts`, `search-setup.ts`, `testing.ts` and
 * `apps/sidecar/src/db.ts`. The first five are the server's migration and operator surface; the
 * last is the desktop's PGlite door, which the device composition drops by construction. Those
 * are paths, not exemptions: none of them is reachable from the roots below, and if one becomes
 * reachable this fails naming the chain.
