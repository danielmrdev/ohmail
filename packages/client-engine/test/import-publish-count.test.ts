/**
 * ═══ HOW MANY TIMES A FIRST IMPORT PUBLISHES ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Every publish makes the shell re-derive the whole mirror and re-render, which is the most
 * expensive thing the renderer does — measured in a real browser renderer at megabytes of
 * resident peak per re-render over a full window, independent of how many rows the
 * window holds. A first import did one per backlog page, which is hundreds of them for a change
 * the reader could not act on between pages.
 *
 * COUNT VERSION MOVES, NOT NOTIFIES. `subscribe` fires on every `notify()`, but the shell reads
 * the mirror's VERSION through `useSyncExternalStore`, so a notify over an unchanged version costs
 * nothing. Counting notifies made a 303-to-153 cut look like a fix while no reader re-rendered
 * once fewer; this file counts what a reader counts.
 *
 * Every guard below was watched RED against a named mutation and the implementation restored.
