/**
 * ── THE BODY FAN-OUT IS BOUNDED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `bodyRequests` deduplicates per message id, which is the wrong axis for the caller that hurts.
 * The Screener preview hydrates EVERY held message of the selected sender from one effect, and a
 * sender with forty held messages is forty distinct ids — no duplicates, nothing to deduplicate,
 * forty requests in one tick.
 *
 * That is the reported defect, seen from the other end: a body record that is not `ready` answers
 * `html: null`, and the viewer renders its plain-text fallback for a null html. So a burst large
 * enough to overrun the connection limit shows a preview of text dumps beside one or two properly
 * rendered frames, on exactly the senders — the ones with a conversation behind them — where the
 * reader most expects a mail client.
 *
 * Three things are asserted, and the third is the one that would rot silently: a rejected fetch
 * must give its slot back. A limiter that leaks on failure starves every later hydration and
 * looks exactly like the bug it was added to fix.
