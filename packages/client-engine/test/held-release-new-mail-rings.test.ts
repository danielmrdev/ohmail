/**
 * NEW HELD MAIL REACHES AN OPEN SCREEN WITH THE PULL THAT BROUGHT IT.
 *
 * Mail at the gate from a sender the account already decided joins the held set on the server,
 * and nothing rang for it: a surface already showing the Screener re-offered at its next ask (a
 * shell mount, or a settings write anywhere). The engine now re-asks its one held-release door at
 * the settle of a pull that carried such mail — judged against the mirror's rules after the pull,
 * so a rule arriving beside the message counts — once per pull, and only once a surface asked.
