/**
 * `receiptsByDay` on a runtime without `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` — Hermes, the phone's engine.
 * Measured 2026-09-21: the day a receipt arrived, every iOS launch died in `WorldProvider` with
 * "undefined cannot be used as a constructor" — the day heading built the word "today" with an API
 * Hermes does not ship. The heading now takes the caller's own word, falls back to the platform's
 * where it exists and to the weekday where neither does; this file deletes the constructor for the
 * duration of a case and drives all three arms of that order, asking for a label, not an exception.
