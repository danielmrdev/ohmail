 * the large rig mailbox — and a body is written twice, each write bumping the version, so the eager
 * pass's batch of bodies bought twice as many derivations. Nothing counted either.
 *
 * The store tests here drive the REAL `MemoryMirrorStore`, so a counter that stopped being called
 * from `bucketsOf` is red rather than quietly zero for ever — a test against `beginDerive` alone
 * would go on passing with the seam unwired.
