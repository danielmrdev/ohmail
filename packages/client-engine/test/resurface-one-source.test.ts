/**
 * ═══ "THIS MESSAGE COMES BACK LATER" HAS ONE SOURCE ════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The fact was carried TWICE on the wire — embedded on the message (`MessageDTO.triage`, which
 * `TriageService.setState` re-emits for exactly this reason) and as its own `message_state`
 * entity — and the two had SEPARATE readers: the chip read the copy on the message, while the
 * Ohbox's hold-out and the bottom piles read the records. A client that receives one home and
 * not the other therefore disagreed with itself: the desktop stood a parked message in the main
 * list wearing its "Back <day>" chip while the web had it under Triage.
 *
 * Both halves are reachable. The snapshot is windowed on the message's ARRIVAL date, so a
 * parked message older than the window is in neither the window nor the tagged tail; a later
 * `message` update then delivers the row with its `triage` embedded while the original park's
 * `message_state` change sits below the cursor the client adopted at bootstrap — the message
 * without its record. The reverse (a record for a message the mirror does not hold) titles a
 * pile entry with a raw identifier.
 *
 * The fix is ONE CARRIER read through ONE selector: `winningStates` folds both wire homes into
 * a single claim per message, and `oneSourceReader` — applied at `OhmailEngine.read()`, so no
 * surface can forget it — stamps that claim onto the message's own `triage`. The record stops
 * being a second read source and becomes a pure input to the fold.
