/**
 * WHERE A RESURFACED MESSAGE GOES WHEN IT IS MARKED DONE — measured, because a user could not
 * find one (2026-09-21): a message parked, come back, forwarded and then released with Done was
 * "nowhere". Done is one deliberate `mark_seen` (the pin is spent server-side in the same
 * transaction) and, for a booked row, a `triage_set: none` first; neither moves a folder — the
 * Resurface pile has no IMAP folder of its own, so the message stays where the mailbox had it.
 */

 * So the message is in the Ohbox's "Earlier" — at its ARRIVAL slot (owner ruling 2026-09-18:
 * Earlier is one chronology and a read never moves a row), which for a ten-day-old message is
 * below everything newer. It is NOT in History: History lists mail from senders nobody has
 * screened and the pre-baseline backlog, never a decided sender's mail. Search finds it by
 * subject. The toast the release shows names that slot now ("filed under Earlier at <date>").
