/**
 * A SCREENED-OUT SENDER NEVER REACHES THE OHBOX, WHATEVER DOOR THE DECISION WENT THROUGH.
 *
 * Seen on the desktop's Cloud mirror during a first sync (2026-10-01): the press went through
 * the sidecar, whose own pull was still paging, so the drain after the confirm carried no rule. The overlay's rule retired at the settle, the queue page (read from the account live)
 * stopped listing the sender, and their mail presented in the Ohbox until the sidecar caught up.
 * One arm per door shape; the adapter's real decide parsing runs inside the engine.
