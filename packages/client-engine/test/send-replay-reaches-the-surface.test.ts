 * ═══ THE SERIALIZER'S HALF OF `firstSend` ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * The middle of the field's three homes: the answer's admitted shape, this parser, and the
 * surface that says the sentence. A field that stops here is a server telling the truth to
 * nobody. Shape-checked rather than forwarded — what arrives becomes a statement about
 * somebody's mail on a screen, and absence is the only other state.
 * Mutations: the parse dropped → 1; the wire value forwarded unchecked → 3, 4; the field put on
 * every send → 2.
