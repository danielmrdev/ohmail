/**
 * THE ACCOUNT IS NEVER A ROW IN ITS OWN SCREENER QUEUE, WHEREVER THE MAIL SITS.
 *
 * `ConsentOptions.ownAddresses` exists so "the user appears in their own Screener queue" cannot
 * happen. It held for mail in the INBOX and not for a message physically in `ohmail/Screener`:
 * the own guard keeps such a row in its own place, `screenerSegments` grouped on the presented
 * folder, and the row was minted — while `activity` held no entry for the address and
 * `counts.activeUndecidedSenders` counted nobody behind it. The queue's rows and the partition's
 * reckoning differed by one, and the account could be asked to screen itself
 * (OWN-ADDRESS-GATE-ROW-IS-STILL-A-QUEUE-ROW, measured 2026-09-11).
 *
 * The fix is ONE PREDICATE: `ownAddressKeys` lives in the partition module and the queue's
 * grouping calls it, so the two halves cannot hold different answers about who the reader is.
 * Two properties are pinned here, and either alone is passed by an accident:
 *
 *   · AGREEMENT — `waiting.length === counts.activeUndecidedSenders` over every fixture below,
 *     which is the arithmetic the defect broke, with the exact row sets beside it.
 *   · ONE PREDICATE — the queue imports it and defines none (by import, not by grep), and a
 *     case-and-whitespace variant of an own address is still excluded, which a hand-rolled
 *     second list comparing raw strings could not do.
 *
 * Scope, stated: the WAITING segment. A row physically in `ohmail/Screened` or
 * `ohmail/Quarantine` is an explicit placement somebody made — the partition's own rule — and it
 * keeps its row, because that segment is the only surface the message has. Asserted below rather
 * than left to be rediscovered.
 *
 * ── HOW TO WATCH IT FAIL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Over the projection the partition now presents own gate mail in the INBOX (ruling 2026-09-25),
 * so the grouping guard decides only for a RAW reader: delete the `segment === "waiting" &&
 * own.has(key)` guard and `own-mail-never-a-screener-decision.test.ts`'s raw-reader case goes
 * RED. Put the partition's own row back at the gate and the GATE-PHYSICAL case here goes RED.
 * Spell a second own-address set inside `screenerSegments` and the census block goes RED.
