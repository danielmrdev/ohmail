/**
 * THE DURABLE CURSOR MOVES ONLY AFTER THE PAGE IT COVERS IS DURABLY COMMITTED.
 *
 * ## THE DEFECT — two of the four ways the mirror could outrun its own disk
 *
 * A review found four ways the client mirror persists a delta cursor past rows that never reached
 * disk, and named them one defect in four coats: **the cursor advances on the intent to persist
 * rather than on the fact of it.** Two of the four are properties of `BaseMirrorStore` and are
 * closed here.
 *
 *   1. **A FAILED PAGE FLUSH.** `applyResponse` advanced memory and then awaited a persist that can
 *      abort. The write itself is atomic — page and cursor land together or not at all — so the
 *      failure looked harmless. The NEXT page is where it bites: on any later apply the seq guard
 *      correctly refuses the already-applied changes, so the dirty set is empty and the flush
 *      writes a NEWER cursor over a disk that never received the earlier rows. `/sync` sends a
 *      delta once. The hole is permanent, and after a reload the mirror is simply missing mail.
 *
 *   2. **A FAILED WIPE.** `resetForBootstrap` cleared memory and then awaited a wipe that can fail.
 *      Memory empty, disk still holding the old rows, the 410 re-bootstrap writing a fresh cursor
 *      on top: mail the server had deleted came back on the next restart and stayed.
 *
 * ## WHY NO EXISTING TEST COULD SEE EITHER
 *
 * Both are claims about DISK made visible only by a RESTART, and at no point is anything in memory
 * wrong. Every reader assertion in the suite passes over both. So this file's oracle is always the
 * same: build a SECOND store over the same disk and `load()` it — which is what the next boot does
 * — and ask what that mirror holds.
 *
 * ## THE HARNESS
 *
 * A `BaseMirrorStore` whose persistence is a `Map` standing in for IndexedDB, with the three
 * failure injections the arms need. `persist` writes rows, cursor and meta together, exactly as
 * `IndexedDbMirrorStore` does in one transaction, and a failure writes NOTHING — modelling a
 * transaction abort rather than a partial write, which is the honest shape and also the harder one
 * to pass.
