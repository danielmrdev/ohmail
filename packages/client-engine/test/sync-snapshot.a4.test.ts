 * ═══ `GET /sync/snapshot` AS THE COLD-START PATH ══════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `since=0` replays the whole change log: every intermediate state of every row, in the order
 * they happened. A snapshot is the CURRENT state instead, read at one consistent point named by
 * `asOfSeq`, paged newest-first. The two things that make it safe are both structural rather
 * than hoped for:
 *
 *  · the cursor is committed with the LAST page and nothing else can write it, so a crash
 *    mid-snapshot leaves "0" and the next start re-snapshots; and
 *  · `asOfSeq` is the READ POINT, identical on every page, so the delta drain that resumes from
 *    it cannot miss a change committed while the pages were in flight.
 *
 * Every guard below was watched RED against a named mutation of the implementation, then the
 * implementation was restored.
