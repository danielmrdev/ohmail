/**
 * ═══ THE RE-HYDRATION A WIDENED RETENTION POLICY OWES A MIRROR IT ALREADY PRUNED ═══════════
 *
 * The pin that keeps tagged mail in a windowed mirror stops the next eviction. It cannot bring
 * back what the previous policy already deleted, and no delta will: the `message_tags` change
 * that made the row worth keeping sits below the mirror's cursor. A desktop mirror hides this —
 * it is in memory and rebuilt every launch — and a browser's, which persists across sessions,
 * carries the loss for ever.
 *
 * MEASURED FIRST on the shipped path, before any of this existed: a warm windowed mirror missing
 * one tagged message, a server still serving it on the snapshot's labeled tail, one drain. The
 * mirror asked snapshot page 1 and stopped there (`freshenStaleResume`), which is the newest mail
 * and not the tail, and the row stayed missing. That measurement is guard 1 below, inverted.
 *
 * Every guard was watched RED against a named mutation, then the implementation was restored.
