/**
 * ONE QUEUE DERIVATION PER MIRROR VERSION, AND ONLY THE SENDERS A BUMP TOUCHED.
 *
 * `screenerSegments` walked the whole mailbox and minted every row on every version bump, and the
 * shell asks for it on every bump whether or not the Screener is open. Measured over a real store
 * and the real projection (`test/rigs/screener-segments-rig.mjs`): milliseconds at a modest queue
 * and tens of milliseconds at a large one, every bump, with most of it in
 * the per-message stamp. Two caches answer it — one keyed on (reader, version, day, zone, locale,
 * own set) so callers of one bump share a derivation, one keyed on the sender's own bag BY ENTITY
 * IDENTITY so a bump re-derives the senders it touched and nobody else.
 *
 * The wall-clock figures live in the project's design notes and in the rig, never here: a
 * millisecond assertion in a suite is a flake. What is guarded here is the only thing that makes
 * a cache safe — that it answers exactly what the full derivation answers.
