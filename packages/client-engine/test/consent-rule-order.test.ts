/**
 * ONE ORDER FOR A SENDER'S RULES, ON THE SERVER AND ON EVERY CLIENT.
 *
 * The router files a sender's mail by core `standingRule` (the minimum under `compareRules`); the
 * clients present that sender's INBOX mail by `consentIndex` + `decidedDestination`. Each pair
 * below is one where the client's old order (newest-created first, the first admitting twin wins,
 * the address before its domain) and the router's disagreed. Every case asks the client for the
 * router's answer, in both input orders, and once through the partition a person sees.
