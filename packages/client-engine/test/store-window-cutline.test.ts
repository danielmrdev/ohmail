/**
 * ═══ THE WINDOW COVERS THE CUTLINE ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Dormancy decides whether a sender is still worth a decision: active ⇒ the Screener asks,
 * dormant ⇒ their mail is filed in History and it never does. The server measures that over the
 * WHOLE account; a windowed client measures it over its mirror. The two agree only while the
 * mirror holds every message the cutline reads.
 *
 * MEASURED: the dormancy dial offers 90, 180 and 365 days and the browser window keeps 90, so two
 * of the dial's three rungs put the cutline past the window by one click. At 180 days a sender
 * whose only mail is 120 days old reads ACTIVE on the server and is not in the windowed mirror at
 * all — their mail is in neither pile on this device while the server is still asking about them.
 *
 * The ruling: where the mirror is a window, the server's word decides, so the window is widened
 * to cover the cutline rather than the client answering a question it cannot see. `maxRows` is
 * untouched and still decides the size — which is what the ceiling is for.
 *
 * The twin here is `senderActivity` over the whole message set: it is the same rule the server
 * runs in SQL (`activeSenderExpr`), pinned to it by `apps/mobile/test/screener-server-parity.test.ts`.
