/**
 * THE MIRROR'S SIDE OF A ROW THE PAGE WITHHELD.
 *
 * A `/sync` page bounds itself by the bytes the transport refuses on, and a draft row heavier
 * than any page can carry arrives as `body: null` with `bodyOmitted: "over_page_budget"` — `html`
 * and `rationale` withheld with it, because those are where the weight was. Withheld rather than
 * dropped: the row LISTS, and the text is one `GET /drafts/:id` away.
 *
 * The parser's rule is that the reason changes NOTHING: `draftBodyKnown` is the one predicate, so
 * the surface that renders bodies takes the same fetch path it takes for `over_ceiling` and for a
 * reason this build has never heard of. That last case is the one worth measuring — an older
 * client meeting a newer server must not treat an unknown reason as "there is no draft". What the
 * SURFACE then does with it is measured where it lives: `apps/webapp/test/draft-body-hydrate.test.ts`.
