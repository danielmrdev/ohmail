/**
 * ═══ WHAT A FIRST IMPORT COSTS THE WINDOW ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The window suite proves the window RULE. This proves WHEN it is applied, which is a different property and was
 * the defect: `drain()` skipped `pruneToPolicy` on every page answering `hasMore`, so a windowed
 * mirror grew to the whole mailbox on the way in and evicted once, at the end. Measured over a
 * large corpus with the desktop's own options: every row held at the peak — the same
 * per-message cluster count an UNWINDOWED mirror holds (as many `array:(object elements)` in a heap
 * snapshot at that moment) — and 254 whole-mirror derivations before a single row left.
 *
 * So the peak was a function of the MAILBOX while the settled state was a function of the policy,
 * and it is the peak the renderer is charged for.
 *
 * Every guard below was watched RED against a named mutation and the implementation restored.
