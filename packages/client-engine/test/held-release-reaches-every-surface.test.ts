/**
 * "NOT NOW" IS THE ACCOUNT'S, SO EVERY DEVICE DROPS THE OFFER WITHIN ONE PULL.
 *
 * Measured on 0.25.0: dismissed on the web, the offer stayed on the Cloud-paired desktop for six
 * minutes, through Pull new mail and a reopened Screener. The desktop's read honoured the server
 * all along; it simply never asked again after the shell mounted. The dismissal now rings the
 * settings doorbell (`held-release-dismiss-doorbell.test.ts`), and the engine re-asks its one
 * held-release door at a drain's settle when that stamp moved since its last answer — only once
 * a surface has asked, so an engine that never shows the offer (the phone) pays nothing.
