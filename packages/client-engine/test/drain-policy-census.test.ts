/**
 * ONE DRAIN POLICY IN THE TREE — the engine's half of the census `apps/sidecar/test/
 * one-pipeline.test.ts` keeps on the mirror's half (INSTANT-ARCH §6.7, stage 7's first adopted
 * responsibility).
 *
 * There are two drivers that drain the account's change feed into a local store: this engine
 * (over IndexedDB on the web, sqlite on the phone) and `apps/sidecar/src/cloud-mirror.ts` (over
 * the desktop's relational PGlite store). They stay two — the relational apply is load-bearing
 * for the LOCAL door and cannot be deleted — so what has to be one is the POLICY they share:
 * when a mirror counts as behind, what a surface may say about its age, and how big the pages of
 * a catch-up drain are.
 *
 * That policy forked twice inside one week, and both times it forked SILENTLY, with matching
 * values: `STALE_RESUME_MS` / `CLOUD_STALE_RESUME_MS`, `BACKLOG_PAGE_LIMIT` /
 * `STALE_REPLAY_PAGE_LIMIT`, and a hand-written stale predicate and freshness ternary on each
 * side. Nothing was red. The defect such a fork produces arrives one change later, on one
 * surface only.
 *
 * So the rule this file holds is not "the numbers agree" — they always did — but "there is only
 * one place the numbers COULD be written". The definitions live in
 * `packages/core/src/drain-policy.ts`, on a dependency-free subpath both graphs can reach, and
 * the two drivers may re-export them but may not restate them.
 *
 * ── HOW TO WATCH IT FAIL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Write `const STALE_RESUME_MS = 5 * 60_000;` (rather than the re-export) into `engine.ts` and
 * the definition case goes RED; hand the freshness ternary back into `OhmailEngine.freshness()`
 * and the derivation case goes RED. Both restore green.
