/**
 * THE DURABLE CURSOR MOVES ONLY AFTER THE PAGE IT COVERS IS DURABLY COMMITTED — the two ways
 * that promise could still be broken by something OTHER than a failed write.
 *
 * `cursor-durability.test.ts` closed the two failures a single store can cause itself: a page
 * flush that aborts, and a wipe that does not happen. Both are about this process's own writes.
 * The two here are about a fact this process cannot observe going stale underneath it, and they
 * are the same defect: **the cursor advances on something that is no longer true.**
 *
 *   3. **ANOTHER TAB WIPED THE DATABASE.** The mirror is per ACCOUNT, so two tabs share one
 *      IndexedDB database. A `410` in tab A empties it; tab B knows nothing, and its next flush
 *      writes its page and its cursor onto the emptied baseline. On disk: a few rows under a
 *      cursor claiming thousands of seqs. Every one of those deltas has been sent, and `/sync`
 *      sends a delta once, so the mailbox is permanently truncated and looks healthy.
 *
 *   4. **AN ABANDONED SNAPSHOT'S ROWS.** A cold bootstrap that dies mid-stream leaves rows at
 *      the OLD `asOfSeq` and a cursor of "0". A snapshot is a statement of LIVE state, so a later
 *      attempt at a NEWER `asOfSeq` cannot mention anything deleted in between — it simply does
 *      not carry it. Those rows therefore ride into a completed bootstrap, and the cursor then
 *      commits PAST their tombstones. Deleted mail comes back and stays.
 *
 * ## WHY NO EXISTING TEST COULD SEE EITHER
 *
 * Same reason as the first two: both are claims about DISK, visible only after a restart, and at
 * no point is anything in memory wrong. So the oracle here is the same one — a SECOND store
 * loaded over the SAME disk, which is what the next boot does — and every case builds one.
