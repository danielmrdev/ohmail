/**
 * PUNCTUATION IS PART OF THE WORD — the `D-U-N-S` miss, and the two rules that answer it.
 *
 * Reported: typing `D-U-N-S` into search answered *"Nothing on this device."* while
 * an opened message's SUBJECT reads "Your D-U-N-S Number is enclosed." Nothing was broken about
 * the index or the request; the query simply did not survive tokenization. `tokenize` was
 * `text.toLowerCase().match(/[\p{L}\p{N}]+/gu)` with a two-character floor, so
 *
 *   ·  the QUERY `D-U-N-S` became `["d","u","n","s"]` and then `[]` — every part is one letter —
 *      and `search` returns the empty answer for a query with no tokens, and
 *   ·  the SUBJECT lost the same four letters, so even a phrase pass could not have found it.
 *
 * Two rules, and they are separable — each has a case here that the other cannot cover:
 *
 *  1. A hyphenated or dotted COMPOUND indexes as the compound verbatim (`d-u-n-s`) and its parts,
 *     as the stores do. The query tokenizes identically. The joined spelling `DUNS` reaches only
 *     a message that spells it so: the stores have no joined lexeme, and this is their first paint.
 *  2. A query that tokenizes to NOTHING is matched verbatim, case-insensitively, over subject
 *     and sender. `x` and `#4` are questions; answering them with silence is not.
 *
 * The residual boundary is asserted rather than left to be discovered — see the last case.
