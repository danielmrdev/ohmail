/**
 * A SEND THAT DEFINITELY DID NOT GO NAMES THE ROW IT LEFT, so the surface can bind it. A press
 * with no `draftId` makes the adapter create the row; when the send is then refused for good the
 * row is an ordinary draft again, and a surface that is never told which row it was creates a
 * second one on the next press (measured on a phone with the network cut: one row per press).
 *
 * The controls: a retryable refusal names nothing (it stays queued under its key), and the
 * `unverified` naming is untouched (send-ambiguity.test.ts owns it).
