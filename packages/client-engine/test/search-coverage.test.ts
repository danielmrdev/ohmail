/**
 * GAP WHAT SEARCH ACTUALLY COVERS, AND THE SENTENCE THAT SAID OTHERWISE.
 *
 * The shipped product told the user *"Searching the server archive isn't wired up yet. These
 * local results are complete."* They were not. The local index reads `subject`, `from` and
 * `snippet`; `m.body` is a fixtures-only extra the wire `MessageDTO` has no field for
 * (`packages/services/src/dto/types.ts` → `MessageDTO`), and `snippet` is `bodySnippet()` in
 * `packages/core/src/pipeline.ts`: whitespace-collapsed, `.slice(0, 200)`.
 *
 * Measured on the hosted service on 2026-08-04 (both live mailboxes):
 *
 *   most stored bodies are longer than the snippet cap, and a large share longer than
 *   their own snippet · the median body runs well past the cap · many snippets
 *   sit exactly on the cap and some are empty · only a small part of the stored body
 *   characters fell inside a snippet, so little of the mail was locally searchable.
 *
 * The first three tests are the DEFECT ITSELF, and the second of them is the one that would
 * have caught it originally: a term that exists only past character 200 of a LIVE-shaped row
 * has to be findable through some path the user actually has. Before this slice there was
 * none — `GET /search` was mounted, spend-classed `read`, RRF-ranked, contract-tested and had
 * ZERO callers on any surface.
 *
 * The demo-shaped control beside it is deliberate: without it, a regression that broke the
 * INDEX rather than the coverage would pass the live case for the wrong reason.
