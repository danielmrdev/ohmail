/**
 * THE ENGINE'S TRASH PAIR — absence is an ANSWER, and a restore is not a mutation.
 *
 * Three properties, and each of them is a state the product has to be able to render rather than
 * a happy path:
 *
 *  1. an adapter with NEITHER capability reports "unavailable" and never throws — the demo,
 *     which is fixtures and zero network, and any build talking to a server with no Trash route;
 *  2. an adapter with ONE of the two reports unavailable as well, because a Trash list whose
 *     Restore is dead is not the feature and a half-forward must turn it off rather than half on
 *     (the wrapper that rebuilds the adapter as an object literal forwards them one at a time);
 *  3. a `create` after a `delete` re-adds the entity — the apply contract's own rule 4, which is
 *     what makes the restore's end-to-end path work without the restore emitting anything.
