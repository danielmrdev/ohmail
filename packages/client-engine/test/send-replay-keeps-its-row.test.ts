/**
 * A SEND THAT MADE ITS ROW REPLAYS THAT ROW. A press with no draft row creates one and then sends
 * it; the row's id lived only in the adapter, so a reload replayed the send with no row named and
 * `POST /drafts`, which ignores the key, made a second one (RESTORED-ROWLESS-SEND-REPLAY-MAKES-
 * ANOTHER-ROW). The row is persisted on the outbox entry before the send request goes.
 *
 * Two shapes: the send failed before the server took it (the row is still a draft), and the
 * server took it and the answer was lost (the row has left `draft`, so a PUT is refused).
