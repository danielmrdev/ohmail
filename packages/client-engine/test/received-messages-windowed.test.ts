 * — `BROWSER_WINDOW`'s days and rows over a larger account whose mail predates the
 * window — the mirror climbs to its floor and then reads the floor for twenty consecutive pages while the
 * reader takes in the whole account.
 *
 * {@link OhmailEngine.receivedMessages} counts the rows at the reader's door instead. Every guard
