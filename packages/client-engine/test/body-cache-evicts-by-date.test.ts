 * {@link BODY_CACHE_MAX} of them, so the two only agree if they agree about WHICH. While the trim
 * evicted the least recently WRITTEN, they did not: the pass writes newest-first, so one poll of
 * K arrivals dropped the K newest bodies the pass had just fetched, the next pass re-fetched them
 * and the next write dropped the band below — measured at 40 ids and 480 KB on every one of five
 * consecutive do-nothing drains over a large mailbox, with rank 1 among the holes every time. The
 * order is what these cases pin; the sizing is `body-cache-bound.test.ts`.
