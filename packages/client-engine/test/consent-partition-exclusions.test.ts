/**
 * WHY A SENDER WITH MAIL IN THE SCREENER FOLDER IS NOT OFFERED AS WAITING.
 *
 * The sibling file pins what the partition does to each MESSAGE. This one pins the complement,
 * per SENDER: the folder holds mail from N senders, the queue offers M, and every one of the
 * N − M has a name. That is not readable from a browser — a screen-OUT decision leaves the mail
 * exactly where it was, so the mirror's message rows record nothing — and a page script that
 * re-derives the queue as a date cutline gets three exclusions it cannot explain and calls it a
 * defect.
 *
 * The observable is the queue the product renders: `screenerSegments` over
 * `presentationReader(mirror, consentPartition(mirror))` — the web shell's own read
 * (`app/shell/screener-state.ts`), the same rule the server answers in SQL (pinned by
 * `services/test/consent-cutline.pg.test.ts`) and the phone's (`state/live.ts#presentedWorld`).
 *
 * Two properties, because either alone is passed by an accident:
 *
 *   · ATTRIBUTION — {@link why} names the arm from the PARTITION's output, never from the
 *     fixture, and its `offered` verdict is asserted equal to the rendered queue. A classifier
 *     that agreed with the fixture and not with the queue would prove nothing.
 *   · ONE INPUT — each arm's fixture differs from its neighbour's by exactly one field, and each
 *     names the flip of that one field that puts the sender back in the queue. Every arm below
 *     was watched both ways; a fixture that happened to line up with the arm it demonstrates
 *     cannot pass, because the flipped twin is measured in the same case.
