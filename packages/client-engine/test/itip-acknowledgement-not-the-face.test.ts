/**
 * ═══ A CALENDAR CLIENT'S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IS NOT A CONVERSATION'S LATEST WORD ═══════════════
 *
 * The 2026-09-16 shape: a user accepted an invitation in the Mac's Calendar and a second later
 * the Ohbox row read "Accepted: …", "Me → the colleague". No person wrote that.
 * `ohboxView` already holds our own AUTOMATIC replies out of "Earlier" — "nobody finished with
 * anything" — and a calendar acknowledgement is the same class. Two arms mark it, since only one
 * of its two homes is mirrored: the top-level `method=REPLY` header, and the subject, trusted
 * ONLY on own-sent mail.
