/**
 * A store that records what reached `persist`.
 *
 * `getMeta` alone cannot prove a meta write was PERSISTED — it reads the in-memory map, which
 * `setMeta` fills before it flushes, so a `setMeta` that dropped the flush entirely would still
 * satisfy a read-back. A review found exactly that hole in the first version of this file. The
 * durable half is what the drain's completion stamp depends on across a relaunch, so it is asserted
 * against the call that carries it.
 *
 * ── WHY IT EXTENDS THE BASE AND NOT `MemoryMirrorStore` ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `MemoryMirrorStore.persist()` declares NO parameters — a legal narrowing, since it ignores them
 * — so an override that records the three the base passes is not assignable to it (TS2416), and
 * `super.persist(a, b, c)` is TS2554. The first cut of this file did exactly that and ran green,
 * because vitest only transpiles and this package's tsconfig includes `src` alone:
 * **a test file in this package that does not compile still passes.** Extending the abstract base
 * lets the override match the real signature instead of fighting a narrowed one — and the file is
 * now typechecked explicitly, see the command in this commit's message.

/**
 * A META WRITE IS NOT A RECORD CHANGE, AND `version()` MUST NOT MOVE FOR ONE.
 *
 * `version()` is the stamp every derived cache keys on. The shell reads it through
 * `useEngineVersion` and rebuilds the consent partition, the presentation projection and every
 * whole-mirror pile selector when it moves. `OhmailEngine.drain()` writes the drain's completion
 * timestamp through `setMeta` at the end of EVERY successful drain, including the overwhelmingly
 * common one that carried no changes — so while `setMeta` bumped, an idle client rebuilt its whole
 * view once per poll, for ever, to record a timestamp nothing derives from
 * (the project's design notes §5).
 *
 * The meta namespace is two keys — `LAST_DRAIN_AT_META` for `freshness()` and the stale-resume
 * verdict, `SNAPSHOT_PREFIX_SEQ_META` for the bootstrap's own bookkeeping — and `bucketsOf`'s
 * per-version cache is over RECORDS, which a meta write does not touch.
 *
 * A SURFACE DOES READ IT, and this file used to claim otherwise while the production comment it
 * mirrors had already been corrected: `apps/mobile`'s `mirrorSettled` reads
 * `getMeta(LAST_DRAIN_AT_META)` directly for the phone's world memo. What makes dropping the bump
 * sound is not that nobody reads meta but that nobody derives it THROUGH `version()` — mobile
 * re-reads the store per pass, on a trigger of its own. See `store.ts`'s `setMeta` and
 * `apps/mobile/src/state/world.tsx`.
 *
 * `idle-drain-derives-nothing.test.ts` owns the same invariant through the drain; this owns it at
 * the store's own door, because that is where the rule lives and where a future edit would break it.
 *
 * Mutation watched: restore `this.ver++` inside `BaseMirrorStore.setMeta` → the first assertion
 * fails with 2 where 0 is owed.
