/**
 * THE ENGINE RETAINS THE FETCHED BYTES, AND AS THE POST-DOWNGRADE TYPED BLOB.
 *
 * The Quick-Look preview parses a PDF or a text part from these bytes directly, because it must
 * NOT re-`fetch` the object URL — `connect-src 'self'` refuses a `blob:` fetch on the live host,
 * a fact no jsdom test can see. So the engine holds the Blob beside the URL. The security-critical
 * property is that it holds the DOWNGRADED blob: an `image/svg+xml` part is
 * `application/octet-stream`, so a consumer that minted its own URL from it could not run the SVG's
 * script as ohmail. This is the structural test that would fail if the wire blob were exposed.
