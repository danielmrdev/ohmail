/**
 * THE TWO FACTS A SCREENER ROW CARRIES ABOUT ITSELF, AND THE ONE VOCABULARY IT SAYS THEM IN.
 *
 * on an account with more than one mailbox a row did not say
 * which of the reader's addresses the stranger wrote to, and could not: the fact was on the
 * message all along and no row carried it.
 *
 * `screenedOn` had two producers in two vocabularies: a
 * `${day} ${month}` band no other row wears, and `iso.slice(0, 10)` from the optimistic press.
 * The sheet then guessed between them by the SHAPE of the string.
 *
 * The cases below are written so the OLD code and the NEW code disagree. A screened-out sender
 * whose newest mail is from a previous year is the discriminator for the stamp — both spellings
 * answer "22 Jul" for a date inside this year, which is why the existing derived-row case could
 * not see the defect and did not move when it was fixed.
