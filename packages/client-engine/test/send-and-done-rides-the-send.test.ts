/**
 * SEND + DONE'S RELEASE RIDES THE SEND. The release a press earned was held in the pressing
 * surface's memory, keyed by lane, so a send that went queued and was confirmed by a later boot
 * found no arm: the message went and the source stayed. The plan is persisted with the send's own
 * outbox row and handed back on its confirmed result, the replayed one included.
 * Mutation: `andDone` left off the persisted row → case 1 red; off the confirmed result → 1 and 2.
 * Cases 3 and 4 are the third road, Try again on the strip: the abandoned record keeps the plan and
 * the retry's rebuilt entry carries it (either spread removed → red).
