/**
 * THE INSTANT INDEX STOPPED FREEZING THE WINDOW.
 *
 * THE REPORT. A customer's desktop pegged its webview's CPU for minutes the moment
 * they searched. A five-second sample of every ohmail process on that machine put the Tauri host
 * and the engine's node near idle and the WINDOW flat out, with every hot frame in
 * JavaScriptCore: `LocalAllocator::allocateSlowCase`, `MarkedBlock::Handle::sweep`, `JSRopeString`
 * finishSweep, `operationRegExpMatchFastGlobalString`, `operationJSMapFindBucket` — a JavaScript
 * loop allocating rope strings out of global regex matches and filling Maps.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM, in two halves, and both are measured here:
 *
 *   1. THE INDEX READ EVERY HYDRATED BODY. `add` tokenized `${snippet} ${body}` — a rope string
 *      per message and a term set the size of the mail. Measured on a large mirror with
 *      most bodies hydrated (2026-09-13): many times the characters tokenized per build,
 *      against the bodies gone, and one build seconds of CPU against a fraction of one.
 *   2. THE WHOLE INDEX WAS REBUILT WHENEVER THE MIRROR'S VERSION MOVED — which is every drain
 *      and every body publish. So each keystroke after a bump paid a whole build: typing one
 *      seven-letter word with the mirror moving between keystrokes cost 26 767 ms of CPU on that
 *      corpus, against 570 ms after. That is the freeze, as a number.
 *
 * What this file pins is the three rules that replaced it: no body text enters the index, the
 * FIRST build past {@link SEARCH_INDEX_SYNC_MAX} is handed back to the event loop every
 * {@link BUILD_SLICE_MS}, and a version bump costs the messages that MOVED rather than the mirror.
 * The incremental half is in `search-index-incremental.test.ts` beside this one; what stays here
 * is the slicing and the freshness the two halves together deliver.
