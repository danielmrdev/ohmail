/**
 * EAGER RECENT-WINDOW HYDRATION (owner ruling, 2026-08-21).
 *
 * "Loading the full mail" cost a round trip at the moment of opening — ~100 ms warm against the
 * hosted API, seconds on a serverless cold start — because a body was fetched on EXPLICIT INTENT
 * only. The ruled contract: once a drain has settled, the engine hydrates the bodies of the
 * mail the views present (the mirror IS that recent window — Ohbox groups, Reads, Receipts all
 * render mirror subsets) in the background, so opening any recent message finds the body already
 * local. The archive tail stays on-demand: it is not in the mirror, and `listOlder`'s rows keep
 * their fetch-on-open behaviour.
 *
 * The bounds are the contract's second half:
 *  · OPT-IN (`eagerBodies: true`) — the webapp shell and the desktop window pass it; an embedder
 *    that never asked (apps/mobile) keeps its windowed bootstrap semantics untouched;
 *  · at most {@link EAGER_BODIES_MAX} newest messages per pass, chunked through the same
 *    four-wide non-urgent slot queue every hydration shares, so an OPEN (urgent) never waits;
 *  · admission is {@link bodyPlan}'s — a ready body is never re-fetched, a failed one is never
 *    re-asked inside the session, a protected or fixture-bodied message
 *    issues nothing, a cap-withheld body stays the honest record it is;
 *  · it never touches the rendered-pin LRU — prefetching a full batch of ids must not evict the
 *    64 pins that keep the windowed prune off messages someone is actually reading.
