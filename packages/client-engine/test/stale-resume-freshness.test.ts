/**
 * ═══ STALE-RESUME FRESHNESS — the newest page converges BEFORE the backlog replays ═══════════
 *
 * The delta feed is ascending-seq by contract, so a mirror that resumes hours or days stale
 * replays its backlog OLDEST-FIRST: the change a returning user actually cares about — the mail
 * that arrived while they were away, the triage they did on the other device — is in the LAST
 * page of the drain, behind every page of history before it. Measured on the hosted service
 * (a live account's full-log replay): several pages, a long wall time, and the newest message's
 * create applied at the very end — while `GET /sync/snapshot` page 1 (the newest page
 * of messages, every live thread and all small state) answered within a second.
 *
 * So a drain that starts on a STALE cursor fetches snapshot page 1 first and applies it
 * ROWS-ONLY — never the cursor — then lets the ordinary delta replay run behind it. The seq
 * guard makes the overlay sound: snapshot rows carry `seq === asOfSeq`, so the backlog's stale
 * intermediate states cannot overwrite them, and a row deleted while the client was away is
 * still removed by the delta's tombstone (the snapshot never carries it, so nothing shields the
 * stale copy). The cursor stays where the delta left it, so a crash after the freshness page
 * re-replays the same backlog — duplicates are what the apply contract absorbs.
 *
 * Staleness is the mirror's own record: the engine stamps `lastDrainAt` meta when a drain
 * completes, on the engine's own clock, and compares against the same clock — no server time,
 * no cross-device skew. A missing stamp on a WARM cursor is read as stale, deliberately: that is
 * every mirror written before this shipped, resuming for the first time.
 *
 * Every guard below was watched RED against a named mutation of the implementation, then the
 * implementation was restored.
