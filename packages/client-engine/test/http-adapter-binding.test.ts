/**
 * THE DEFAULT `fetch` BRANCH, EXERCISED — because in production it was the ONLY branch, and
 * no test had ever taken it.
 *
 * `HttpAdapter` stores a fetch on the instance and calls it as `this.fetchImpl(url, init)`.
 * That call site makes the RECEIVER the adapter. A browser's native `fetch` is bound to its
 * global and rejects any other receiver with a synchronous
 *
 *     TypeError: Failed to execute 'fetch' on 'Window': Illegal invocation
 *
 * thrown before a single byte leaves. In production that killed `OhmailEngine.start()` on its
 * first `/sync` call for every signed-in Cloud account: the mailbox rendered "0 unread of 0"
 * forever, with no console error and no network request, because `app/shell/engine.tsx`
 * catches `start()`'s rejection and discards it.
 *
 * Every other test in this package injects `HttpAdapterOptions.fetch` — a plain function,
 * which has no receiver requirement and therefore cannot fail this way. So the suite was
 * green against a client that could not load mail in any browser.
 *
 * THE FIDELITY THAT MAKES THIS BITE: `receiverBoundFetch` reproduces the ONE property of
 * native `fetch` that matters here — it throws unless its receiver is the global. Node's
 * `fetch` is NOT receiver-bound, so asserting against the real global would pass with or
 * without the fix and prove nothing.
