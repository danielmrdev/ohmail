/**
 * THE RANKING TABLE — one fixed corpus, and every claim the search rule makes, as a row.
 *
 * The complaint this answers was that typo tolerance "can distort the results very much". It
 * could, and the distortion had two shapes, both measured on the demo corpus before this:
 *
 *   · **An exact match demoted.** Scoring was `field weight × match quality`, so a trigram guess
 *     against a SUBJECT (×3) outscored a literal match in a BODY (×1). The query `graphite` put
 *     "Fotos vom Grat" — a mountain ridge — above the message whose body says `graphite`.
 *   · **A one-answer query returning twenty rows.** The fuzzy arm had no floor on the length of
 *     the term it matched AGAINST, so `invoce` reached nineteen unrelated messages through the
 *     two-letter word `in`, and `anna` reached twelve through `and`.
 *
 * The corpus below is built so each row of the table isolates one claim. It is deliberately
 * hand-written rather than taken from the demo fixtures: a fixture edited by another slice
 * would silently change what this file proves.
