/**
 * ═══ AN AUTO-REPLY BY THE AWAY RESPONDER IS NOT IN THE OHBOX ═════════════════════════════
 *
 * The reported shape, in the reporter's words: "when it responds to Reads emails it puts them in my
 * ohbox, basically spamming my ohbox with reads screener messages".
 *
 * The mechanism is entirely here, in `ohboxView`: it unions the account's own sent mail into
 * "Earlier", because writing a message is finishing with it. An automatic reply is the one kind
 * of own-sent mail nobody finished with — and it is worse than merely present, because an
 * own-sent row sits at its own SEND instant, so every fresh auto-reply lands at the TOP of
 * the pile the person reads. One row per answered message,
 * wearing the bulk message's subject as "Re: …".
 *
 * Measured on the account that reported it, before this landed: such rows every day, most
 * of them threaded to a `ohmail/News` or `ohmail/Receipts` original, arriving several a
 * day for as long as the responder stayed on.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE FIX IS, AND THE THREE THINGS IT MUST NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One term in the sent union: `m.autoReplyByUs !== true`. The three controls that bound it:
 *
 *   · a reply THE PERSON WROTE is still in Earlier (`!== true` is not `=== false`);
 *   · a row from a server or mirror that predates the field — `undefined` — is still in Earlier,
 *     which is the behaviour every mirror had before the flag existed;
 *   · the ORIGINAL is untouched. This lane moves no message; the Reads row stays in Reads.
 *
 * And nothing is hidden: an auto-reply is still in the Sent folder view, which is where sent mail
 * lives. That is the whole of the hotfix's user-visible promise.
