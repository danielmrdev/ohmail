/**
 * SECOND HALF — THE INDEX IS UPDATED, NOT REBUILT.
 *
 * The mitigation bounded the cost of the rebuild; it did not remove it, and what it cost was
 * freshness — past a few hundred messages the index was rebuilt at most once every thirty seconds,
 * so mail arriving inside that floor was not in the instant answer. `SearchIndex.apply` consumes
 * the messages that MOVED, so a version bump costs those and nothing else, and the floor is gone.
 *
 * TWO THINGS MAKE IT CORRECT RATHER THAN MERELY FAST, and both are what this file measures:
 *
 *   · THE REVERSE MAP. A removal takes back exactly what the message posted. Guess at it — walk
 *     the terms, or re-tokenize fields that have already changed — and a posting survives its
 *     message: a query answers with mail the mirror does not hold, and clicking it opens nothing.
 *   · THE CEILING AT THE TOP. The catch-up refuses past `SEARCH_INDEX_SYNC_MAX` changed messages
 *     rather than spending the keystroke, so a re-bootstrap that replaces every row falls back to
 *     the sliced build instead of arriving as one whole-mirror walk inside a keypress.
