/**
 * ═══ THE FRESHNESS CONTRACT'S THREE STATES — `engine.freshness()` (INSTANT-ARCH §6.6) ════════
 *
 * A surface rendering a mirror owes the reader one of exactly three presentations: a skeleton
 * over a mirror no drain has ever settled (`unknown`), LABELED content over a mirror whose last
 * settled drain is old (`stale` — "as of 14:32 · catching up"), and plain content otherwise
 * (`current`). The engine is the ONE derivation of that verdict; this file pins the derivation
 * and the settle announcement the label's clearing depends on.
 *
 * Every guard below was watched RED against a named mutation of the implementation, then the
 * implementation was restored:
 *
 *  · stale-shown-as-current — `freshness()` returning `"current"` regardless of the stamp's
 *    age turns the "reports stale once the stamp outlives STALE_RESUME_MS" guard red.
 *  · label-stuck-after-current — removing the drain's settle publish (the one after the
 *    LAST_DRAIN_AT_META write) turns the "the LAST notification of a drain already reports
 *    current" guard red: nothing else announces the settle, so a label driven by subscription
 *    would stand until the next coincidence.
 *  · identity churn — dropping the value cache turns the stable-identity guard red, which in
 *    the shipped shell is a `useSyncExternalStore` render loop.
