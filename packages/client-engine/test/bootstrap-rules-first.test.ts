/**
 * ═══ RULES BEFORE MAIL ON THE `since=0` FALLBACK ═══════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The reported shape: during a bootstrap, already-screened senders present as UNSCREENED,
 * because the `since=0` replay interleaves by seq — a sender decided AFTER their mail arrived
 * replays as mail-first, and for the whole stretch between those seqs the consent cutline reads
 * the absent rule as "no decision". Unknown is not undecided.
 *
 * The snapshot path already has the ordering (page 1 carries the account's whole rule set —
 * `sync-service.ts`), so the fallback is the one drain that could render a message whose
 * sender's decision had not arrived. The engine now opens that fallback with a `types=rule`
 * drain to the horizon, rows only, before the first mixed page.
 *
 * Every guard below was watched RED against a named mutation, then the implementation restored.
