/**
 * ═══ THE TWO ABSENCES THE MIRROR HOLDS, AND WHY ONLY ONE OF THEM IS A DELETION ══════════════
 *
 * `get` answers `undefined` for both, and they mean opposite things. A DELETE writes a tombstone
 * (`entity: null` at the deleting change's seq — apply rule 4): this device's own record that the
 * row is gone. A PRUNE writes NOTHING (`MirrorStore.prune` hard-deletes, because a tombstone
 * carrying a seq would make the seq guard refuse every later delta for that id). So a caller that
 * settles a confirmed deletion on absence alone settles it against an eviction, and the IMAP
 * mailbox — the master — is never asked.
 *
 * `isTombstoned` is the question behind the reader. It reads the record and remembers nothing, so
 * the bound is the mirror's own: there is no recent-tombstone ledger with a lifetime of its own.
 *
 * ── MUTATION-WATCHED, each restored by copying the pristine file back and `cmp` ─────────────
 *   · `isTombstoned` reading `rec === undefined || rec.entity === null` → all five red;
 *   · `isTombstoned` answering `false` always → all five red;
 *   · `entries()` no longer skipping tombstones, so the eviction pass can pick one up → (3) red
 *     on the tombstone, which is the only mutation that reaches the second half of that case;
 *   · the eviction pass evicting nothing → (3) red on the LIVE row, which is what tells "the
 *     window produced this state" from "the assertion would pass over an unpruned mirror";
 *   · a side ledger remembering tombstones → (5) red on the post-prune read.
