/**
 * ═══ A BATCH OF BODIES COSTS ONE VERSION BUMP, NOT ONE PER BODY ══════════════════════════════
 *
 * Every `putLocal` bumps the mirror version, and the shell re-runs every whole-mirror derivation
 * whenever that number moves (`useEngineVersion` -> `useSyncExternalStore`). A body used to be
 * written TWICE per id — the `loading` marker, then the answer — so the eager pass's thousand bodies
 * handed the shell a whole-mailbox derivation per write. Measured on the large rig mailbox that is minutes of
 * one core and RSS climbing into gigabytes, which is the 0.16.2 incident's pinned core and the six
 * minutes between the first sync finishing and the machine running out of memory
 * (the project's design notes).
 *
 * So the notify COUNT is the property under test, not the bodies' contents. It is the thing that
 * scales with the mailbox, and it is invisible to every test that only asks whether a body landed.
 *
 * The bound: two commits per chunk of {@link BODIES_IDS_MAX} — one for the markers, one for the
 * answers — whatever the chunk holds. Not one per body.
