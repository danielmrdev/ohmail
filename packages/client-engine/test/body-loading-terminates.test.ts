/**
 * ── "LOADING THE FULL MESSAGE…" HAS TO END. THAT IS THE WHOLE FILE. ─────────────────────
 *
 * `body-hydration.test.ts` proves the state MACHINE — that a 500 lands in `failed`, that a
 * failure is not re-asked automatically, that concurrent callers join one request. It proves
 * all of that against an adapter that always answers.
 *
 * The defect this file is written for is the one that appears when the adapter does NOT answer,
 * and it was invisible to every existing test because every existing double resolves. The
 * loading note was reported appearing often and sticking; the mechanism turned out to be worse
 * than a stuck spinner:
 *
 *   1. `fetch` has no deadline, so a hung request never settles.
 *   2. `fetchBodyInto` writes `{state:"loading"}` and its only exits are the two arms of a
 *      try/catch that never runs.
 *   3. `hydrateBody`'s single-flight map is cleared from that request's own `.finally`, so the
 *      entry survives for the life of the tab — and every later call, INCLUDING the Retry
 *      button's `{retry:true}`, short-circuits on `if (inFlight) return inFlight` and joins the
 *      promise that is never coming back.
 *
 * So the spinner was not merely stuck, it was unrecoverable, and no surface renders a control
 * for `loading` because `loading` was designed to be a state that ends.
 *
 * Every assertion below was watched go red against the named mutation and then restored.
