/**
 * WHAT A MAILBOX RECEIPT TAKES FROM A MIRROR, TYPE BY TYPE (the census half).
 * EXCLUSIVE: the row belongs to one mailbox — keyed by it, or by one of its messages — so the
 * receipt takes the removed mailbox's and keeps the other's. SHARED: the row is the account's,
 * or leaves by its own door, so the receipt keeps it. Total over {@link MIRROR_ENTITY_TYPES} (a
 * `Record`, so `tsc` refuses a type nobody classified) and driven through a real store over each
 * type's real shape. Watched red: the cascade's second pass keyed on the row id alone
 * (`store.ts#cascadeMailboxRemoval`) leaves four message-keyed types behind.
