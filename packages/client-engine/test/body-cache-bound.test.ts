/**
 * ═══ THE HYDRATED BODIES ARE BOUNDED, AND READING DOES NOT GROW WITHOUT LIMIT ════════════════
 *
 * A `message_body` is client-local, so `/sync` can never remove one, and before the desktop's
 * mirror became a window nothing removed one at all: a reading session's bodies grew for as long as
 * the window stayed open. Each is a whole mail — 57 KB measured on realistic HTML with an inline
 * image — so the eager pass's batch alone is megabytes
 * (the project's design notes).
 *
 * The bound is {@link BODY_CACHE_MAX}, and the test reads the shipped constant rather than a copy.
 * It is the EAGER window and deliberately not {@link RENDERED_PINS}: an evicted body is an absent
 * record, which the next open re-fetches, and `prefetchRecentBodies` asks for the newest
 * {@link EAGER_BODIES_MAX} after every settled drain — so a smaller bound would have the pass and
 * the evictor chase each other for ever. That relationship is asserted below, because it is the
 * reason the number is what it is.
