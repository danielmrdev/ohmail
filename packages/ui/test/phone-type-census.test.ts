/**
 * ═══ EVERY STEPPED SIZE READS THE SLOT, AND NOTHING ELSE DOES ══════════════════════════════
 *
 * The phone type step is one pixel added to every text role between 10.5px and 15.5px at phone
 * width. The mechanism is a token slot: the literal stays where it is and gains
 * `+ var(--type-up)`, so there is exactly ONE declaration per size and the step is decided in one
 * place (`base.css`'s width block) rather than in 380 of them.
 *
 * That only holds while every declaration actually carries the slot. 366 of them were rewritten by
 * a codemod, which is precisely the kind of change that misses a handful and looks finished — and
 * a missed declaration is invisible: the page renders, one line is a pixel smaller than the line
 * beside it, and no test in the suite has an opinion. This is the test with the opinion.
 *
 * ── THE THREE RULES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. every `font-size` literal ≤ 15.5px carries `var(--type-up)` — unless its selector is
 *     allowlisted, because a mark, an avatar initial and a keycap are not reading text;
 *  2. every text CONTROL carries `var(--input-floor)` instead — iOS zooms the page when a focused
 *     control is under 16px, so those are floored rather than stepped;
 *  3. nothing at 16px or above carries either — the band has a top, and a step applied above it
 *     would be a second, unruled decision.
 *  4. no `font-size` is typed into a COMPONENT at all — a size in a JSX style object is not a
 *     declaration this census can see, does not carry the slot, and cannot be found by reading
 *     the stylesheets. Zero today, so it is a fence rather than a cleanup.
 *
 * ── THE ALLOWLIST IS NAMED, NOT INFERRED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A census that skipped whatever it could not classify would pass over exactly the declarations
 * most likely to be wrong. Each exemption is a selector written out here with its reason, and rule
 * 1 fails for anything else — including, deliberately, the wordmark: stepping the brand by a pixel
 * on phones is the kind of change nobody would notice until it shipped.

 * by omission: a new stylesheet is covered only if whoever added it also remembered to add it
 * HERE, and nothing fails when they do not. Two files were found missing from it at once, which
 * is the measurement that ended the list — the census had been reporting a clean phone type step
 * while a date picker and a sort control sat at their desktop sizes on every phone.
 *
 * So the set comes from the import graph instead: every `import "….css"` in the shell's own
 * source, resolved to a real file. A stylesheet nobody imports is not on a screen, and a
 * stylesheet the shell imports cannot escape this census by being forgotten.
 *
 * THE MARKETING TREE IS EXCLUDED, and that is a design decision rather than an oversight: the
 * landing pages are their own typographic system, sized for a poster rather than for a mail
 * client's chrome, and stepping them would be a redesign. It is named in code here so the
 * exclusion is visible to whoever reads a passing run. The branded 404's stylesheet joins it: the page
 * moved into `(product)` so every build carries it, and it keeps the website's poster type it was
 * designed in rather than taking the shell's step.

 * or a string. It also treated every specifier as a relative path and silently CONTINUED when the
