/**
 * THE CENSUS — every door that ranks a search calls the ONE rule, and nothing ranks in private.
 *
 * There are three surfaces that can put search results in an order in this product, and they
 * share no code at all: the client engine's in-memory index (TypeScript over a mirror), the
 * hosted service (SQL over Postgres), and the view that MERGES the two and therefore decides
 * the order the reader actually sees. A rule written out three times is three orders that agree
 * until the day one of them is tuned, and the tuning is invisible — a list is still a list.
 *
 * So the rule lives in `@trafficflow/core/search-rank` and this file is what makes "shared"
 * a fact rather than an intention. It is the same shape as
 * `packages/client-engine/test/drain-policy-census.test.ts`, for the same reason.
