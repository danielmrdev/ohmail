/**
 * EVERY `updateLocator` CALL SITE SAYS WHERE THE MESSAGE WAS.
 *
 * The third argument is not for the write — the repository ignores it. It is for the known-set
 * memo, which holds the projection that call moves a row of and is handed a row id the projection
 * does not carry. Without it the memo cannot find the entry and throws the whole mailbox away:
 * measured at one full re-read per cycle for every cycle of an import, which on an organizer is
 * every cycle there is.
 *
 * So the default is safe and the omission is REFUSED here rather than discovered as a performance
 * row a second time. A new call site that genuinely cannot name the old locator belongs in
 * {@link EXEMPT} with the reason written, not left silent.
