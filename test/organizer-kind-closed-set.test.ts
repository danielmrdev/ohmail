 * ONE CLOSED SET, AND EVERY WRITER ASKS IT.
 *
 * The device rig's laptop twin wrote `X-Ohmail-Organizer-Kind: desktop`. No build writes that
 * word: the sidecar writes `organizerKind ?? "local"`, the worker `cloud`, the phone `mobile`. So
 * every reader parsed the twin's claim as `unknown`, the phone stood down fail-closed — correctly —
 * and run 6 recorded a product row that was the rig's own word (2026-09-12). A worker fixture
 * spelled the same word at `apps/worker/test/profile-failure-latch.test.ts:146`, where nothing
 * typechecks it: `apps/worker` has no typecheck script.
 *
 * The word list is a VALUE in core now, the two parser doors ask one predicate, and the rig tool
 * derives its set from that line rather than carrying one.
