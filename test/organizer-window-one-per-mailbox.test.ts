/**
 * ═══ ONE STALENESS WINDOW PER MAILBOX, AND EVERY READER OF THAT MAILBOX USES IT ═══════════════
 *
 * `decideLease` and `peekLease` both take `staleAfterMs`, and both DEFAULT it to ten minutes when
 * it is absent. That default is right for a caller with no configuration and wrong for a caller
 * that has one, because the two functions are meant to describe the same folder: the gate answers
 * "may I organize", the preview answers "who holds this", and a process that asks them under two
 * different windows gets two different worlds.
 *
 * ══ WHAT WENT WRONG, MEASURED ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `apps/worker/src/index.ts` passed its configured `organizer.staleAfterMs` to the GATE and
 * omitted it from both `readLeasePeek` calls, so both previews silently used ten minutes. With a
 * 24-hour configured window and two installs each carrying a record 14–15 minutes old:
 *
 *   · the preview reported `stopped`, with every holder `fresh: false`;
 *   · the gate reported `stand_down` — held, per the configuration;
 *   · and the release arm, which certifies a release only when NO holder is fresh, therefore
 *     stamped the mailbox RELEASED while another install was inside its own lease.
 *
 * The other preview call had the same omission and refreshed the row that names the organizer to
 * say nobody organizes a mailbox the same pass had just stood down from. Nothing failed: both
 * calls are valid, the parameter is optional, and the default is a plausible number.
 *
 * The sidecar had it right all along, which is what made the difference legible rather than a
 * matter of opinion — it forwards its own configured window to every peek.
 *
 * ══ WHY A CENSUS AND NOT A CASE ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The behaviour lives inside `startWorker`, whose seams reach a real Postgres and a real mail
 * server, so a case that drives it belongs to the box suites and cannot run here. What this file
 * can do is refuse the SHAPE, and the shape is exactly what was wrong: a call that omits the
 * window. So every `readLeasePeek` call in the worker must forward one, and the check is on the
 * call's own argument rather than on a spelling anywhere in the file — a `grep` for
 * `staleAfterMs` would have passed the broken version, because the gate's forwarding is in the
 * same file.
 *
 * An UNRECOGNISED call shape is refused rather than skipped. A call whose argument is not an
 * object literal cannot be read by this census, and quietly passing it is how a census stops
 * covering the thing it was written for.

/**
 * Every file that reads the lease preview and HAS a configured window to forward. The sidecar's
 * own call moved behind `answerLeasePeek` when the phone's consent door started asking the engine
 * to look, so the core module is the reader now and the sidecar's window reaches the read through
 * it. `packages/api/src/organizer-peek.ts` calls the preview too and is deliberately NOT here: it
 * carries no configured window at all, so there is nothing for it to forward — filed as
 * ORGANIZER-PEEK-API-HAS-NO-CONFIGURED-WINDOW rather than covered by a list that would then be
 * asserting about a caller this rule has no answer for.
