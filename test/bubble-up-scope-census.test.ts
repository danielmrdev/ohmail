/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  EVERY HOST THAT RUNS THE RESURFACING PASS NAMES THE MAILBOXES IT ORGANIZES
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `bubbleUpPass` flips `bubbled_up` to `resurfaced` for the mailboxes its caller passes, and the
 * organizer lease is per mailbox. A host that called it with the account alone flipped rows in a
 * mailbox somebody else organizes — so the scope is not optional and the pass refuses without it.
 * That refusal is only half a guard: a host can be added, or an argument dropped in a refactor,
 * and the pass would then do nothing where it used to do the work. This census is the other half.
 *
 * The call sites are ENUMERATED by parsing for the CALL rather than listed by hand: the source is
 * read through `source-scan.mjs` (comments, strings and templates blanked, positions kept), every
 * `bubbleUpPass(` that is not the declaration is taken with its own argument span, and each must
 * name `mailboxIds`. The count is asserted first, because a census that found nothing passes
 * every assertion under it — the shape a rename would take.
