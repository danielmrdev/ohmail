/**
 * ═══ A READS SURFACE SAYS WHICH ADDRESS OF YOURS THE MESSAGE ARRIVED AT ═══════════════════
 *
 * On an account with several mailboxes a Reads row and its card were silent about which of the
 * person's own addresses received the message, so a work message and a private one were the same
 * row. Three things this ships wrong, and a case each:
 *
 *  · **A label on an account that has one address.** "Delivered to <your only address>" under
 *    every row says nothing. The gate is the ABSENCE assertion — the one that regresses quietly.
 *  · **The header read instead of the delivery fact.** To/Cc is silent on a Bcc, names the list on
 *    list mail and misses a plus address. The source is `m.mailboxId`, and the case that shows it
 *    is a message whose To names an address the account does not hold.
 *  · **The recipients ruling relaxed to carry it.** A one-recipient card draws no recipients block
 *    (`reads-recipients.test.tsx`); dropping that gate to fit the mailbox in would ship "To: you"
 *    under every subject. The label is its own node — asserted here as label present AND block
 *    absent on the same card.
