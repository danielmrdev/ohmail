/**
 * ═══ `#/address/<addr>` PUTS THE ADDRESS VIEW ON THE STAGE ═════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The route parsed, the view existed and the controls linked to it for a whole slice before
 * anything mounted it: `effectiveView` had no `address` case, so following an address landed on
 * an EMPTY stage under a URL that named a person. Nothing failed — the router was right, the
 * view's own render suite was green over a hand-mounted `AddressView`, and the address bar said
 * exactly what the reader had asked for. That is the shape this file exists to refuse, so the
 * assertions are about the SHELL and not about the view: that the stage carries `.view-address`,
 * that the header names the address the hash named, and that the URL is not rewritten out from
 * under it.
 *
 * ── ESCAPE, AND WHY IT HAS TWO ARMS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `goAddress` is a hash ASSIGNMENT, so following an address stacks a history entry and stepping
 * back returns to the list it was clicked in (`routing.ts` says so at the function). Escape is
 * that same gesture, which is why it is spelled as the step back rather than as a hard-coded
 * destination: a reader who followed an address out of Reads is returned to Reads.
 *
 * The exception is a tab whose FIRST entry is the address itself — a pasted link, or a reload on
 * this hash. There is nothing behind it, so stepping back would leave the product altogether on
 * a keystroke that means "close this". The Ohbox is the floor there. Both arms are driven below,
 * and they are told apart by where they land, not by reading the branch.
