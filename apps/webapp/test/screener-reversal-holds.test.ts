/**
 * UNDOING A SCREENING DECISION REPORTS FAILURE — it does not pretend.
 *
 * ## THE SHAPE, AND WHERE IT CAME FROM
 *
 * `screener-decision-holds.test.ts` pinned this defect on the DECIDE paths: `commit` fired
 * `void engine.mutate(…)`, a refusal rolled the overlay back, and the sender reappeared in the
 * queue with the optimistic toast still on screen claiming the decision. The same three controls on
 * the two adjacent segments were left carrying it, deliberately and out of that slice's scope:
 *
 *  · **Screened out → "Allow"** (`allowScreened`) — `moveAll`, or a fixture decide;
 *  · **Spam → "Not spam → Ohbox"** (`notSpamToOhbox`) — three branches, all unwatched;
 *  · **Spam → "Not spam → Screener"** (`notSpamToWaiting`) — `moveAll`.
 *
 * Every one of them raised its toast at press time and threw the result away. It is WORSE here than
 * on the decide, for one reason: a decision has an 8-second undo window and a second toast when the
 * window closes, so a reader has two chances to notice. These presses have neither. The toast was
 * the only account of them that ever existed, and on a refusal it was a false one.
 *
 * ## THE ONE THAT NEEDED MORE THAN A `.then`
 *
 * A PINNED spam row — a sender marked spam in this session, remembered in `s.pins` because the
 * mirror has no other record that the reader made that call. Every other refusal is rolled back for
 * us: the engine drops its overlay, `/sync` goes on reporting the mail where it is, and the derived
 * row reappears. The pin is the client's own state, so dropping it on the press and never restoring
 * it left the surface PERMANENTLY out of step with the mirror — the mail still in Quarantine, and
 * no row naming it until a reload. That branch restores the pin at its own index.
 *
 * ## AND THE PARTIAL RELEASE, which is why the mark is keyed on the whole bag
 *
 * A derived row's id is the sender's NEWEST message in the folder. Release five and have the newest
 * land while an older one is refused, and the row that comes back is minted on a different message —
 * so a mark on the pressed id would be a mark nothing asks about. The last case below is exactly
 * that: two messages, only the older one refused, the row back under a new id and marked.
 *
 * ## THE HARNESS
 *
 * A `/sync` world that serves changes after the client's cursor and applies `POST
 * /messages/:id/move` the way the service does. `refuseMove` flips the move to a 404 — the live
 * shape of it being a message this mirror still believes is in Quarantine while the server has
 * already moved it on. `refuseMoveOf` refuses one id, for the partial case; `holdMove` leaves the
 * request in flight for ever, which is the only way to observe a press CLEARING a note before the
 * wire has answered. The controls are driven through the previews' own confirm strips ("Not spam…"
 * → "→ Ohbox"), never by calling state directly: the whole defect was in what the surface said, so
 * the surface is what is pressed.
 *
 * ── AND IT EMITS NO RULES, WHICH IS A DELIBERATE CHOICE AND WAS NOT THE FIRST ONE ──────────
 *
 * `live-walk-shell`'s own `page` helper pairs every INBOX message with a consent rule, because the
 * shell partitions mail by sender and an INBOX message from a stranger presents at the gate. Mail in
 * `ohmail/Quarantine` and `ohmail/Screened` needs no such help: neither folder is an
 * UNDECIDED_RESIDENCE (`consent-cutline.ts` — only `INBOX` and `ohmail/Screener` are), so an
 * explicit placement is already an answer and the projection keeps its hands off it.
 *
 * Emitting one is worse than unnecessary — it breaks the guard. A rule whose destination is
 * `ohmail/Quarantine` makes the cutline present the sender's INBOX mail back in Spam, so a release
 * that SUCCEEDED left the row exactly where a refused one does and the control case could not tell
 * the two apart. Measured while writing this file, and worth stating: what the fixture must not do
 * is give the success and the failure the same appearance.
