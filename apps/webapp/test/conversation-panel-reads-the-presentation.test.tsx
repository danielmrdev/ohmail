/**
 * THE WEB PANEL READS THE PRESENTATION, through the shipped shell and the real engine. A reply sits
 * physically in INBOX, threaded into Lena's conversation by its headers, while the presentation holds
 * it: its sender is undecided, or a screened-out rule for them has landed and not been carried out.
 * The phone's reader (the presented mirror) leaves it out; the web panel and its attachment asks must
 * too. Mutation: point `AppShell`'s `conversationOf` back at `engine.read()` — the panel shows x2.
