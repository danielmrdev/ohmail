/**
 * ═══ WHAT THE DRAFTS SCREEN SAYS AFTER A HANDOVER ════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `QAO-SCHEDULED-SEND-ORPHANED-BY-MIGRATION`'s surface half, and the reason the row is HIGH
 * rather than a bookkeeping note. The measured screen:
 *
 *   Scheduled
 *   Invoice for the paper order        Sends Tue 14:50
 *
 * for a Tuesday 14:50 that had gone, on an install that could never send it and would never say
 * so. `scheduleLabel` prints a past instant as an ordinary weekday and clock with no past-tense
 * marker, so the promise renders identically before and after its own moment — for ever.
 *
 * The fix does not touch this view. It makes the ROW true, and this file is the assertion that a
 * true row renders as the truth on this client: the appointment leaves the "Scheduled" list
 * entirely, lands in Drafts under the standing `scheduleFailedNote` frame, and quotes the
 * server's sentence. That is the send-window contract's existing shape for a schedule that could
 * not be kept (`send_error` is schedule-only; a failed schedule wears the sentence), reused
 * rather than extended — which is why no new copy key was needed on this surface.
 *
 * ── HOW TO WATCH IT FAIL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Delete the `d.status === "draft" && d.sendError` note from `DraftsView` and the second case
 * goes red with the row carrying no sentence at all — a message the person was promised would
 * send, sitting silently in Drafts. Run.
