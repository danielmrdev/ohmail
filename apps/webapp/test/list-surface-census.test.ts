 * ═══ ONE READING, NOT SIXTEEN HAND-WRITTEN CONDITIONS ══════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The phone renders every list through one pure function; the web had the same discipline by
 * hand per view, and the Ohbox missed — its empty sentence waited for `settled` while its count
 * spoke the moment a row landed, which is the partial count measured on the managed web. The
 * rule now lives in `@ohmail/client-engine` (`listSurface` / `countWhen` / `saysEmpty`) and this
 * census is what keeps the views on it: a view that states a mailbox fact reads it from there,
 * and a view that decides on `settled` by hand is refused by name.
