/**
 * THE PER-VIEW ERROR BOUNDARY IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DECORATION.
 *
 * A render throw in a pile used to unwind to Next's root and paint the entire tab as the client-
 * side "Application error" — rail, sync strip and every way out gone with it. `ViewBoundary` keeps
 * that throw inside the pane. The proof has two halves, both here: WITHOUT the boundary a throwing
 * render escapes to the caller (so the guard has something real to stop), and WITH it the throw
 * becomes an in-pane fallback while a sibling — standing in for the rail — is untouched.
