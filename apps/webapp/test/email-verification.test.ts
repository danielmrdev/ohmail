/**
 * Stage-2 the webapp half of email verification.
 *
 * Every claim here fails SILENTLY if it regresses, which is the only reason a source-reading
 * test earns its place:
 *
 *  1. **The `/verify-email` page is wired into the origin's route tables.** Missing from the
 *     middleware matcher it loses the nonce CSP and the two §7b headers; missing from
 *     `OWN_PATHS` it is a path the split no longer accounts for. Neither breaks a build.
 *  2. **The §7b duties are actually discharged.** `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and the
 *     `replaceState` scrub are the price §7b charged for keeping a credential in a query
 *     string. A missing header is invisible until somebody reads a proxy log.
 *  3. **The screen does not auto-submit the token.** This is the security property of the whole
 *     slice at the UI layer: an auto-POST on mount is the account pre-hijack that
 *     `AuthService.verifyEmail`'s password binding exists to prevent, and it is EXACTLY the
 *     "simplification" a future reader will be tempted by.
 *  4. **The copy tells the truth about a constant response.** The post-register screen must not
 *     claim an account was created, because on one of the two branches none was — that claim
 *     would re-open in the UI the oracle the 202 closed on the wire.
