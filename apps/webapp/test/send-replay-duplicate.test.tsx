 * ═══ THE RESTORED SEND'S RESULT IS DROPPED, AND THAT IS A SECOND DELIVERY ════════════════════
 *
 * ── THE TRACE, VERBATIM FROM THE REVIEW ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Press Send BEFORE the first autosave, so the mutation carries no row and the ADAPTER will make
 * one. Lose the response — the verb is queued in the durable outbox under `send-key-1`. Reload.
 * The boot replay dispatches the restored entry, the server delivers it and answers `sent` with
 * the row it made... and `replayOutboxInner` keeps only `{ timedOut, held }` and DISCARDS that
 * result. Nobody is told. The queue empties, so the create gate opens, and two seconds later the
 * autosave writes a SECOND row for the message still sitting in the composer.
 *
 * Then the person edits it — they have no reason to think it went out — and the edit is what turns
 * a stale draft into a second delivery: the fingerprint no longer matches the record, so
 * `resumeSendLock` drops `send-key-1` as a mismatch, and Send goes out under a FRESH key. Two
 * copies at the recipient, and the product's one guarantee is broken.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The two numbers a person would count: how many sends reached the server, and what the account
 * holds afterwards. Both are RED at this commit and are written down as they are measured, so the
 * fix is judged against the trace rather than against a description of it.
