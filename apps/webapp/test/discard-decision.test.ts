/**
 * WHAT THE DRAFTS LIST'S DISCARD DOES WITH EACH HOLD — the truth table behind `discardDraft`.
 * The server admits the discard of an `unverified` row and refuses a running send by name, so
 * every hold but two goes to the wire. The two that stay are each a rendered refusal: a row still
 * `sending`, and a jar this browser cannot read (invariant S(4): a recovery fails closed on
 * `unknown`). Mutation: return `{ kind: "wire" }` for `unknown` → the last case reads red.
