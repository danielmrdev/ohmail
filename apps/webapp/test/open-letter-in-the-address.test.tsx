/**
 * A LETTER OPENED OUTSIDE THE OHBOX IS IN THE ADDRESS. History, Answer Later, Trash, folders and
 * tags read in a column of their own, whose pick the bar never saw: the address kept the view's
 * bare route, a reload opened the view's first letter, and Back left the view instead of the
 * letter. The column's pick is reported now, the bar claims it, and the claim restores it.
 * Mutation: the pick arm of the bar's `openOnScreen` removed → every case red on the address.
