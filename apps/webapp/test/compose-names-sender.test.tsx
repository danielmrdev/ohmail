/**
 * THE COMPOSER NAMES THE ADDRESS IT IS SENDING FROM — at both widths.
 *
 * The row this closes said "Compose never names the sending address, at either width", and
 * it was true: the form rendered To, Subject and an editor, and resolved the sender behind them
 * from whichever mailbox had received the newest message. One change put the From row in as the
 * first field — a `<select>` when there is something to choose, a static `<output>` naming the
 * address when there is one — and a second made the picked From the mailbox that actually
 * sends, which is what turned the line from a courtesy into a claim.
 *
 * `compose-from.test.ts` drives the RESOLUTION exhaustively (93 cases: the default, the stored
 * pick, the domain match, the refusals) and `compose-composition.test.ts` asserts the control is
 * in the head. Neither reads the ADDRESS off the screen, and neither varies the width — so the
 * sentence the row is about, in the words the row uses, was the part nothing held.
 *
 * ── WHAT "AT EITHER WIDTH" CAN AND CANNOT MEAN HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * jsdom lays nothing out, so a width is a `matchMedia` answer and a stylesheet, not a pixel. Both
 * are driven for what they can each say: the shell is mounted with the phone media query matching
 * and with it not matching (the app switches real layouts on that), and the stylesheet is read
 * for a rule that would hide the row or its region at a narrow width. A `display: none` inside a
 * media query is the only way this row disappears at 390px while passing every render test at
 * the default width, which is exactly the failure the row reported.
 *
 * ── WHICH BRANCH THIS FIXTURE ENTERS, SAID OUT LOUD ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The demo world holds SEVERAL mailboxes, so the row renders as the `<select>` and these cases
 * measure that branch (measured, not assumed: a probe printed `SELECT "first@example.test"`).
 * The one-mailbox `<output>` branch is NOT covered here, and saying so is the point — a mutation
 * aimed at it stays green in this file, which reads exactly like "that code is dead" and is not.
 * Covering it needs a compose rendered with a one-choice resolution, and nothing in this tree
 * renders `ComposeView` directly today (every compose test mounts the whole shell, deliberately),
 * so it is filed rather than faked. `compose-from.test.ts` holds the resolution for that case;
 * what is uncovered is its rendering.
