/**
 * THE AUTO-SUGGEST OPT-IN, ON THE WIRE — mail 0040.
 *
 * The opt-in lets ohmail buy a classifier suggestion for waiting senders WITHOUT a press. That is
 * money moving with no click behind it, so every property worth having is a property of the
 * requests the app issues, and this file asserts them there rather than through a rendered label.
 *
 * ── THE FIVE THINGS THAT MUST BE TRUE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. OFF BY DEFAULT, AND OFF MEANS SILENT. With the flag absent — the demo, the desktop, a shell
 *     whose `GET /consent` failed, an API from before 0040 — not one request is issued. The
 *     default has to be the one that spends nothing, because the alternative is a fetch error that
 *     costs the user money.
 *  2. IT SUGGESTS, IT NEVER DECIDES. The automatic path may reach `POST /screener/suggest` and
 *     nothing else. No `POST /screener/:id`, and no engine mutation — so no rule, no contact, no
 *     move. This is the invariant the whole feature stands on: the opt-in buys WORK, not a
 *     decision, and a stranger still waits for a human. Asserted by watching the calls, because
 *     "there is no line that does that" is not something a reader can verify later.
 *  3. ONE BATCH, BOUNDED. Exactly one purchase per mounted Screener, of at most
 *     `AUTO_BATCH_SIZE` senders, taken from the FRONT of the queue in the queue's own order.
 *     Re-renders, effect re-runs and a warming mirror must not each buy a batch.
 *  4. A REFUSAL DISARMS AND DOES NOT RETRY. On 402/409/503 the automatic path stops for the
 *     session. An automatic loop against a standing refusal is a flood against a wall.
 *  5. A COLD MIRROR STILL GETS ITS BATCH. On a live account the queue is EMPTY for the first few
 *     renders while the mirror fills. An implementation that looks once and gives up would do
 *     nothing on every live account and pass every test with a pre-warmed fixture — which is the
 *     shape of the "eight of twenty-four journeys went red against a cold account" lesson, run in
 *     reverse.
 *
 * `apps/webapp` typechecks its tests, so the wire shapes below are checked as well as the values.
