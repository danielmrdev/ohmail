/**
 * WHICH RELEASE IS THIS, AND HOW THE ANSWER GETS ONTO THE SCREEN.
 *
 * About states two facts about the running app — the release and the build sha — and they are
 * derived differently on purpose. The sha comes from the deploy environment, because that is
 * where a commit id genuinely lives and `"dev"` is a TRUE answer when there is none. The release
 * comes from the SOURCE, because a version is a property of the tree being built and there is no
 * honest default for it at all.
 *
 * ── THE FAILURE THIS FILE EXISTS TO PREVENT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION ?? "dev"` in the component compiles, typechecks, passes
 * every other test in this suite, and puts **"dev"** in front of a customer the first time a
 * deployment runs without the variable set. A wrong version number is worse than a missing one,
 * because it is quietly believed — and it is quietly believed in exactly the moment somebody is
 * trying to tell support what they are running. So the number is read from `package.json` at
 * config time and there is no fallback branch to take.
 *
 * Source assertions, deliberately: what is being pinned is where the value comes FROM, and no
 * rendering test can see the difference between a correct inline and a fallback that has not
 * fired yet.
