/**
 * THE "COULD NOT BE SAVED" STRIP, and the failure state on the drafted-reply button.
 *
 * Both exist because of one defect with two ends. `GET /drafts/:id` answered `500 internal error`
 * to an id it could not parse; the engine's outbox classifies any unhandled 500 as retryable and
 * used to re-queue it for ever, and the drafted-reply button rendered the server's own
 * `"internal error"` and re-offered itself. The server end is fixed. These are the client end: a
 * bounded queue has to SAY when it gives up, and a surface has to say something usable when the
 * server does not.
 *
 * The strip's absence at zero is asserted first, deliberately — a strip that is always present
 * reading "0 changes could not be saved" is a control that lies about the state it describes, and
 * it is the version of this feature that would pass a careless test.
