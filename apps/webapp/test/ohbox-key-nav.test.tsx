/**
 * j AND k ARE ONE GESTURE IN TWO DIRECTIONS.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS WRONG ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Ohbox rests with NO cursor: the reading column stays at rest until somebody chooses a
 * message, rather than opening the newest unread on nobody's behalf. So the keys are how a
 * reader ENTERS the list, not only how they move inside it — and only one of the two could do
 * it. `j` landed on the first row when nothing was selected; `k` was declared inert in exactly
 * that state, so on a freshly opened Ohbox `j` walked and `k` did nothing whatsoever. Measured
 * against the shipped build: press `j`, then `k`, and the cursor stays where `j` put it.
 *
 * ── WHY THE EXISTING COVERAGE DID NOT SEE IT ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ohbox-thread-grouping.test.tsx` walks j/j/j/k and asserts the fold is never a keyboard
 * stop. Every one of its presses happens with the cursor already ON a row, because its first
 * `j` put it there — so it exercises the two keys only where they were already symmetric and
 * cannot reach the boundary where they were not. That is the whole shape of this defect: the
 * entry move is a fourth case, and a walk that starts by entering can never test it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS ASSERTED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. `k` ENTERS, from the other end. With nothing selected it lands on the LAST row, which
 *      is what makes it the inverse of `j` rather than a second copy of it.
 *   2. `j` then `k` returns to the row it left, over a list that is grouped (a conversation
 *      folded to one row) and session-placed (a resurfaced pin above "New", read history
 *      below it) — so the round trip is measured against the rows as RENDERED, not against
 *      the message array they were built from.
 *   3. `k` on the first row keeps the cursor there. The way in must not double as a way to
 *      lose the cursor: a reader at the top pressing `k` once more has asked for nothing.
 *
 * The fixture is asserted before it is used. A grouped list that failed to fold, or a session
 * order that placed the rows differently, would make every claim below true of a list nobody
 * has.
