 * A SELECTION HOLDING AN OLDER ROW — the bulk verbs resolve it through the Ohbox surface.
 *
 * The selection's verbs resolved each id through the verb reader alone, which answered `undefined`
 * for an Older row: Delete and Move refused the whole press over mailbox `""`, Tag dropped the row,
 * Screen planned nothing, Undo on Read had no inverse. A single row's press is handed its row.
 * One case per arm, through the real shell and engine, over a row only the store holds; `later`
 * resolves nothing and is the control that the ordinary dispatch holds.
