/**
 * NO WIRE ⇒ RESTING VALUES — the door-switch half of the consent contract.
 *
 * `local-consent.ts` states the READ half: a failed `GET /consent` leaves every flag at its
 * resting value. This file pins the WIRE half: a transport that is GONE leaves nothing behind
 * either. The sequence that makes it matter is the desktop's door chooser, which is an overlay
 * OVER the mounted shell — a hosted session with folders ON can switch to the standalone door
 * without `AppShell` ever unmounting, and before this guard the hook kept the departed
 * account's answers: a folders rail (whose verbs the local table does not serve — the
 * client-route census exempts them on exactly the premise this file defends), a signatures
 * pane over no rows, a spending switch reading a row that is no longer behind the window.
 *
 * Review-caught (the 0.12.0 release loop, two rounds): the first round's ruling said the gate
 * unmounts the shell on every door switch, and the second round produced the overlay
 * counterexample. The fix moved the rule into the hook, where it holds for every host.
 */

// Before ANY app import: this file's world has no browser API base, so reachability is the
