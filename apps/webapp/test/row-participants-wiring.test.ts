/**
 * THE CIRCLES ARE AN APP-WIDE ROW LANGUAGE, NOT AN OHBOX FEATURE.
 *
 * `MessageRow` draws a conversation's people wherever their data reaches it — which means the
 * question this file answers is not "does the component work" (`packages/ui` owns that) but
 * "does every list HAND IT THE DATA". That is a wiring fact spread over seven files, and the
 * failure mode is silent: a list that forgets the prop looks completely normal, it just quietly
 * describes a five-person thread as one person, and no render test that nobody wrote will say so.
 *
 * So this is a CENSUS. Every view that renders a mail `MessageRow` is named here, and each one
 * has to (a) accept the shell's binding and (b) pass it on the row; the shell has to hand the
 * binding to every one of them. Adding a new mail list means adding it to this list — which is
 * the point: the next surface should have to say out loud that it does not draw them.
 *
 * ScreenerView is deliberately absent and is the one real exception. Its rows are a decision
 * about a SENDER — "do I want mail from this person at all" — and its circle is that sender's
 * face, the subject of the judgement. A stack of the people in some thread they wrote in would
 * replace the one face the row exists to show.
