/**
 * ═══ AN INVITATION WE CANNOT SHOW SAYS SO, IN THE READING PANE ═══════════════════════════════
 *
 * The 2026-09-16 report's first move: an Outlook Web Access invitation whose mail system sent the
 * event as a LINK — no `text/calendar` part, no card, and the pane rendered OWA's boilerplate AS
 * the message. That silence is what sent a user to another mail app.
 *
 * MUTATION-WATCHED (each reddens the case named and no other): the flag forced false → the two
 * "says so" cases; the line rendered unconditionally → the two "says nothing" controls.
