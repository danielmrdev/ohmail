/**
 * THE AI SURFACE MUST NOT DISAPPEAR WHEN IT HAS FINISHED ITS WORK.
 *
 * Reported from a live account: a Screener of waiting senders, every one of them with a bought suggestion,
 * and no AI anything in the Screener. Not a broken control, not an error — nothing. The buy
 * control's first line was `if (control.available === 0) return null`, and `available` is the
 * count of senders with NO answer yet, so working the queue to completion deleted the feature
 * from the view. "There is nothing left to buy" and "this build has no AI" rendered identically.
 *
 * The two claims below are what replaces that hide, and each was watched go RED against the
 * mutation named in its comment:
 *
 *  1. A ZERO BUY LIST RESTS. The surface stays, states how many senders have an answer, and keeps
 *     the one action still available — asking again — beside it. It renders nothing only when
 *     there is also nothing to re-ask, which is an empty gate the list already speaks for.
 *  2. THE RE-ASK IS THE SAME PURCHASE. It enters the existing machinery — a server dry run, a
 *     confirm carrying the server's own count, one idempotency key per chunk — over the senders
 *     that HAVE an answer. It is not a second flow, and it may not spend before a price lands.
 *
 * The chips and the apply banner are asserted alongside, because the report was about the whole
 * strip: a fix that restored the suggest control by displacing its neighbours would be no fix.
