/**
 * ═══ GAP "WE COULD NOT ASK" IS NOT "THERE IS NOTHING" ════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The strip had per-ITEM state and no state for the LIST, and the shell flattened every
 * non-`ready` outcome to `[]`. So a metadata read that failed rendered exactly what an
 * inline-only message renders — nothing, under a paperclip painted from `hasAttachments` — and
 * after the flag work that second case is the COMMON one: nearly half the flagged messages in a
 * large account carry nothing downloadable. One silence standing for two different sentences,
 * with the failing one permanently invisible.
 *
 * ── THE THING THIS FILE IS REALLY FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This repo has shipped "built, tested, unreachable" seven times — most recently a strip whose
 * update signal could not see its own state, which would have sat on "not loaded" for ever
 * while bytes arrived behind it. A list state that renders beautifully in a component test and
 * never leaves the engine is that failure again. So the reachability is asserted THREE ways,
 * each of which breaks on a different kind of regression:
 *
 *  1. BEHAVIOURALLY — {@link Harness} renders the real strip from the real hook over a real
 *     `OhmailEngine`, wired exactly as `MessagePane` wires it. Flatten `itemsOf` and the
 *     sentence disappears from the DOM.
 *  2. AT THE TYPE LEVEL — `apps/webapp` typechecks its tests, so the `@ts-expect-error` below
 *     is a real gate: revert the prop to `AttachmentItem[]` and it becomes an UNUSED
 *     expect-error, which is TS2578, which is a failing `pnpm -F @ohmail/webapp typecheck`.
 *  3. AT THE SOURCE — `MessagePane` is the one consumer and was being changed elsewhere, so
 *     the fix had to reach it without editing it. That it still does is asserted, not assumed.
