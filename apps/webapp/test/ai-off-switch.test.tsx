/**
 * THE AI OFF SWITCH — the control behind a published promise.
 *
 * `faq.a3` says "you can switch the AI off entirely without losing a single feature that files
 * your mail", and `packages/api/src/routes/ai-settings.ts` names that sentence as the reason its
 * two endpoints exist. A promise with no control on any surface is a false claim, so this file
 * asserts BOTH halves: the sentence is still on the site, and there is a switch that writes the
 * flag it is about.
 *
 * The switch lived inside the subscription pane until that pane left. It is its own pane now
 * because the promise is about the ACCOUNT — a self-hosted server mounts these routes and has no
 * subscription at all, so a switch beside a plan would be missing exactly where the operator
 * pays the model bill themselves.
