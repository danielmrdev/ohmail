/**
 * ═══ THE JUNK RESCUE CLAIMS A COMMAND, NEVER A MOVE ═══════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The product rule is that the API never opens IMAP to apply organization. 0.19.1 recorded the
 * rescue as that rule's one open instance and held the SURFACE to the truth instead: the move was
 * synchronous there, so "Out of Junk" was earned and every other outcome had to say what it really
 * was. 0.19.2 closed the rule — the press records a `junk_rescues` row and the organizer moves the
 * message — so the claim that must now hold is the stronger one: NO sentence on this path may say
 * the move has happened, because when the answer comes back it has not.
 *
 * The guard reads both halves from the tree — the route's refusal vocabulary from the server's
 * source, the rendered keys from the client's own branch — so a NEW outcome or a MISSING sentence
 * fails by name rather than by a count nobody can place.
 *
 * Mutations watched red (2026-09-17), each restored from a pristine copy and proved by `cmp`:
 *  · the client's allowed branch pointed at `junkRescueQueued` ⇒ the key set loses
 *    `junkRescueQueuedAllowed` and this file names it;
 *  · `en.json`'s `junkRescueQueued` reworded to the retired "Out of Junk …" ⇒ the move-claim
 *    case names it;
 *  · a second `ServiceError` code added to `rescueJunk` ⇒ the outcome set names it as unsentenced.
