/**
 * THE BUY LIST MAY ONLY NAME SENDERS THE ENDPOINT CAN ANSWER FOR.
 *
 * The Screener's queue is built from the PROJECTED mirror, so it holds rows for senders whose
 * mail is physically in the INBOX — the cutline presents an active undecided sender at the gate
 * because a decision about them is genuinely wanted. Those rows are minted on an INBOX
 * representative and marked `gatePhysical:false` (#116), and their DECISION works: the commit
 * path re-reads the raw mirror and routes them past the gate as a rule with `applyRetro`.
 *
 * `POST /screener/suggest` cannot be routed past anything. It resolves senders through
 * `heldRows`, which requires `desired_folder = 'ohmail/Screener'`, so a past-the-gate sender
 * comes back in `skipped` with `not_held` — and `toSkips` drops `not_held` on the floor by
 * design, because there is no chip to render for a sender who is not at the gate.
 *
 * ── WHY THAT WAS A LOOP RATHER THAN A WASTED SLOT ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The refusal leaves no trace on the row. The sender still has `ai == null`, so they are still
 * "unsuggested" on the next pass, so they are in the next batch — and auto-suggest runs batches
 * automatically once it is opted into. Every run spent slots out of the user's quoted batch on
 * senders the server had already said it cannot speak for, for ever.
 *
 * The fix is one predicate on the buy list. The row stays, the manual decision stays, and the
 * spender stops being handed a sender the endpoint will refuse. The server's `heldRows` is
 * deliberately NOT widened to match: that is the wire contract for what the gate resolves, and
 * changing it changes what a decide means for every caller.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE MOUNTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `useScreenerState` over a real engine and a REAL projection — `presentationReader` over
 * `consentPartition`, exactly as `AppShell` composes them. Nothing here fakes the flag under
 * test: `screenerSegments` derives it from where the representative actually sits.
