/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  THE RECONCILE RUNS AT BOOT — NOT WHEN SOMEBODY HAPPENS TO OPEN SETTINGS
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `sign-in-reconciles-wake.test.ts` covers what `reconcileWakeRegistration` DOES. This covers the
 * claim that actually closes the defect: that the shipped shell calls it on the way up, so a
 * returning reader's notices come back without their being sent to look for them.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole gap. The reconcile logic already existed — as `SettingsView`'s
 * mount effect — and the switches still lied, because a pane that is never mounted never runs
 * its effects. A guard that drove the pane would have been green throughout the defect.
 *
 * So this mounts the REAL shell, the way the Cloud entry mounts it, over the stale local state a
 * sign-out leaves behind, and asserts the worker's permission to draw is restored with the
 * settings pane never rendered. Mounting the real `AppShell` is what makes the effect being
 * edited away a failure here — a probe wiring its own copy of the gate could not notice that.
