/**
 * ONE ORIGIN, TWO FRONT DOORS. The decision `https://ohmail.app/` makes.

 * The whole feature is a single function with five ways to be wrong, and every one of
 * them is a user-visible failure rather than an error:
 *
 *   • a stranger shown an app shell they cannot use;
 *   • a signed-in user shown a marketing page;
 *   • an EXPIRED or REVOKED cookie treated as a session — the app shell over 401s, which
 *     is the failure that makes "check the cookie is present" the wrong design;
 *   • an ENROLLMENT-scoped session (the password factor alone) promoted to the
 *     full client, which is the escalation `sessions.scope` exists to prevent;
 *   • `?demo=1` making a network request, which breaks a promise the product prints on
 *     the page (the demo-content and testing-bar invariants).
 *
 * So `resolveSurface` takes its `fetch` as an argument and every case below counts the
 * calls. "Zero network" is asserted by a spy that THROWS if it is ever invoked, not by
 * reading the code and believing it.

 * indexed reads — all spent before anything can reject the cookie, which the attacker
 * supplies. `packages/api/src/routes/index.ts` says plainly that there is no throttle
 * middleware and that a per-IP limit is out of scope for that slice.
 *
 * The shape check below is the free half: a value no `generateToken()` could ever have
