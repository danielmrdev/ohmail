 * ═══ ONE COMPOSER PER DRAFT ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

 * A draft has ONE owner at a time. Settling one message may not touch another, and a composer
 * that has been released subscribes to nothing. Both halves of that were broken in the same
 * direction — the composer's identity was AMBIENT, a "current" scratch and a subscription that
 * outlived the composer that opened it — so a settlement or a hydration acted on whichever
 * message happened to be open rather than the one it was for.
 *
 * The line these cases defend: a draft the person is typing is never discarded by another
