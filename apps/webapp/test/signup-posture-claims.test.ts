/**
 * **WHAT THIS DEPLOYMENT ASKS FOR IS ONE FACT, AND THE APP SAYS IT ONCE PER SURFACE.**
 *
 * The measured defect: `login.inviteOnly` ("an invite code is not required") rendered on every
 * managed build whatever `TF_PUBLIC_SIGNUP` said, while `/join` picked its lead by that flag — so
 * an invite-only managed deployment answered a visitor two ways in one visit. The old copy guard
 * next door is a string BAN; a ban cannot see a true sentence rendered in the posture that makes
 * it false.
 *
 * So this reads BOTH ways, because a gate that cannot say what it did not cover covered nothing:
 *   · every posture-asserting sentence in the catalogue is registered against a posture, and
 *   · every posture is named by exactly one sentence per surface, rendered under a gate that
 *     makes it true.
