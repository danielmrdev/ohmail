/**
 * SEND + DONE — THE SECOND SEND ACTION, driven through the WHOLE shell.
 *
 * The rule is the engine's (`sendAndDonePlanFor`, measured in `client-engine`); what is measured
 * here is the shell honouring it: the button appears only where the engine offers a plan, the
 * press sends through the SAME send and files the source only after the engine confirms it, the
 * pill says one thing and carries the Undo that puts the row back, and the source that is now
 * finished stops offering the action.
 *
 * The demo adapter confirms every send, so the REFUSED arm cannot be driven here: it is measured
 * where it decides — `client-engine/test/send-and-done.test.ts` drives the intent with a send
 * that answers `false` and asserts nothing is dispatched, and the case below pins the other half
 * of that composition, that the shell answers the arm `true` on a CONFIRMATION and on nothing
 * else.
