/**
 * ═══ THE BROWSER AND DESKTOP COMPOSER IGNORE `firstSend` ════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * This composer mints its key once per lane and resumes a standing lock on the next press, so a
 * press is refused or resumed but never re-keyed over different words — it cannot reach the
 * state the field describes. A field that means nothing here must change nothing here. The
 * desktop renders this same shell and has no send path of its own.
 *
 * Mutation: a branch on `firstSend` added to `phaseFor` → both cases.
