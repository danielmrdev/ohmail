/**
 * ═══ PRESS SEND AND YOU ARE BACK IN THE OHBOX, WITH THE MESSAGE AT THE TOP ═══════════════
 *
 * Three things had to be true at once for this to work, and none of them was:
 *
 *  · Compose never left. A confirmed send emptied the form and stayed put, so the only thing
 *    that said the message had gone was a toast over a blank compose surface. `cancelCompose`
 *    navigated; the successful path did not.
 *  · The row was not there to arrive at. The engine mints an optimistic Sent copy from the
 *    server's own `{status:"sent"}` answer, and that call sat below a full reconciliation
 *    drain — a drain that cannot carry a sent message, because the only `change_log` row a
 *    send writes is the draft's flip to `sent`.
 *  · And when the row did land it landed at the BOTTOM. "Earlier" is ordered by reading, and
 *    nothing stamps `lastReadAt` on outbound mail, so a sent message sorted below every
 *    message the reader had ever opened.
 *
 * Driven through the whole shipped shell on the demo world, because every one of these lives
 * in the wiring: the engine's dispatch order, the selector's order, and the shell's callback.
 * The demo's adapter answers a minted `providerMessageId` exactly as the live route does — a
 * demo that cannot show sent mail is not showing the product.
