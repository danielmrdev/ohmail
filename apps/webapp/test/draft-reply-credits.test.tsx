/**
 * THE DRAFT FAILED AFTER THE CHARGE — the two sentences, read off the rendered notice.
 *
 * Before this the notice for a paid press that faulted was `failedOpaqueEarly`: "Something went
 * wrong on the server and no draft was made. Nothing was charged." The last four words were false
 * in exactly the sequence that matters — the spend landed, the drafter threw, and the reversal was
 * lost — so the one person who most needed to know about their credits was told the opposite.
 *
 * TWO STATES, TWO SENTENCES, and they are read here from the RENDERED string rather than from the
 * key: a mapping asserted against itself is a tautology, and the thing a person actually meets is
 * the sentence. Both catalogues, because the whole reason this comes out of the catalogue and not
 * off the wire is that the server's `message` is English written for a log.
