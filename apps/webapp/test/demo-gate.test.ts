/**
 * THE DEMO PROMISE, asserted (the demo-content and testing-bar invariants).
 *
 * `?demo=1` says: fixtures only, zero network, nothing leaves this tab. The failure that
 * matters is not "the demo did not open" — it is "a URL presented as the demo booted the
 * HttpAdapter against a signed-in user's real mailbox". Two real ways that happened:
 *
 *  1. `searchParams.demo === "1"` with `searchParams.demo` typed `string`. Next hands a
 *     REPEATED key an array, so `/?demo=1&demo=0` compared `["1","0"] === "1"` → false →
 *     live client, from a link anyone can write.
 *  2. A prerendered `/`. A server component only sees the query when the page renders per
 *     request; any static prerender bakes `searchParams = {}` into the single emitted HTML
 *     and the runtime `?demo=1` never reaches the gate at all.
 *
 * So the rule is: EVERY value is inspected, ANY of them asking wins, and the client
 * re-derives the same answer from `window.location.search` before the engine is built.

  /**
   * THE LIVE ENGINE IS BUILT THERE NOW, AND ONLY FROM AN ID THE SERVER ONCE ISSUED.
   *
   * This test used to assert the opposite, and the old sentence was right about its reason and
   * wrong about what follows from it. The reason is unchanged: a live engine persists into
   * IndexedDB, a persistent mirror has to be named for the account it holds, and the name has
   * to be one the server issued — `packages/client-engine/test/idb-owner.test.ts` is the leak
   * that made it necessary. What changed is where the id can come from. The API now writes it
   * into a readable cookie beside the session, so the browser HAS a server-issued id before it
   * asks anything, and the round trip in front of the first paint bought nothing.
   *
   * What must not soften is the CONFIRMATION. The cookie decides which mirror to open; the
   * session check still decides whether this tab may keep it, and it is a comparison rather
   * than a presence test. `warm-open.test.tsx` drives all of that behaviourally, against a real
   * provider — these are the structural pins on the lines that could quietly remove it.
   *
   * ── THE WARM OPEN MOVED ONE RENDER LATER, AND THE GATES DID NOT MOVE WITH IT ────────────
   *
   * It used to be the last branch of the initializer above. The server cannot read that cookie,
   * so a browser that had one produced a hydration render with the whole mail client in it
   * against a server render of the session gate — a mismatch at every level, which React
   * answers by discarding the server's markup and re-rendering the root. It now happens on the
   * render after hydration, which is a layout-effect flip and therefore still the first frame
   * anybody sees. The three conditions are the same three; only the render they are read in
   * changed.
