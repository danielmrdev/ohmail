/**
 * TRI-F2 — A SEARCH HIT OPENS EXACTLY THE CLICKED MESSAGE, AND THE ARRIVAL IS MARKED.
 *
 * The live sweep clicked a hit and landed with the cursor and the reader on a different
 * message — and with no flash on the one that was clicked. Two mechanisms accounted for the
 * silent half and are pinned here:
 *
 *   1. A conversation folds into ONE row carrying its lead's `data-id`, so the locate pass
 *      matched nothing for any other member. Folded rows now declare every member in
 *      `data-ids`, and the shell's selector falls back to `~=` over it.
 *   2. The windowed lists mount only their top, so a hit deep in the pile had no row in the
 *      DOM at all. The views now reveal an externally-set cursor by scrolling the windowed
 *      scroller (`OhboxView`, `ReadsView`, `ReceiptsView`); the locate pass retries until
 *      the row exists.
 *
 * The end-to-end case below runs the real shell on the fixture world: click a hit, arrive in
 * the Ohbox, and the OPEN message — the one the reading column renders and the row the flash
 * lands on — is the clicked one, by id.
