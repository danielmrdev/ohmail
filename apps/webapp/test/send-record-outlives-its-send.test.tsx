/**
 * A SEND RECORD OUTLIVES ITS SEND (step 1: the red routes).
 * The web send-lock record is the only thing that turns a replayed send's ending back into its
 * composer, and several sites delete records by AGE or by REPLACEMENT while the send they name is
 * still on the durable outbox. Each case below drives one deleting site with the shell's wiring
 * (`useMailSend`, `useComposeAutosave`, `settleCompose`) over the real HttpAdapter and asserts the
 * safe outcome: one delivery per message, and a composer cleared once its send has gone.
 * The fake server replays a key it holds and has no one-hour content claim, so a fresh key for the
 * same words is a second delivery here, as it is on the real service past that hour.
