 * THE SCRATCH BUFFER'S STORAGE RULES — the half of rich compose that must not lose anybody's
 * words.
 *
 * The reply buffer is a data-loss guarantee, not a convenience: `reply-run.test.ts` and
 * `inline-reply.test.ts` both pin that typed text survives leaving and re-entering an editor,
 * and one of those guards protects a defect that shipped. Adding a second field to the value
 * those buffers hold is exactly the kind of change that quietly voids the guarantee for
 * anybody who was mid-sentence when the deploy landed — so the legacy read is the first thing
 * asserted here, before anything about the new shape.
