/**
 * WHERE A LIVE ARRIVAL ENTERS "NEW FOR YOU".
 *
 * The reported defect: a message arriving by sync after mount landed at the BOTTOM of "New for
 * you". The selector (`ohboxView`) hands the group down newest-first, but the view's session
 * placement APPENDED any id it was not already holding, so only the ids present at mount were
 * ever in date order — every genuinely new arrival filed below mail that had been sitting on
 * screen since the mount, for the whole session.
 *
 * The rule now is a STABLE MERGE (`reconcile` in `OhboxView.tsx`): a fresh id inserts at the
 * position the selector's own order dictates relative to the kept rows — before the first kept
 * row the selector ranks older — and the kept rows never reorder among themselves. Three
 * consequences, each pinned here:
 *
 *   · genuinely new mail enters at the TOP, above everything already on screen;
 *   · an OLD unread arriving late — a mirror backfill, or old mail marked unread here or on
 *     another client — files below genuinely newer rows, never above them;
 *   · the rows the reader is looking at keep their order among themselves; an insertion is an
 *     insertion, not a re-sort.
 *
 * An explicit mark-unread here files exactly like one from another client (as reported; it
 * used to lead New for the session, and the pressing surface disagreed with every other);
 * `ohbox-mark-unread.test.tsx` pins it, and here its interplay with arrivals in the same render
 * and on a later sync.
