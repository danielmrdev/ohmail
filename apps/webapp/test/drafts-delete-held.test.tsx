/**
 * THE DRAFTS LIST'S DELETE, DRIVEN THROUGH THE SHIPPED SHELL. `send-hold-census.test.ts` pins the
 * SOURCE — that `discardDraft` asks the predicate; it cannot say whether the answer reaches a
 * person. So the whole client is mounted on the demo world and the buttons are pressed. The row is
 * MADE through compose (the demo world seeds no drafts, and `demo` wins over an injected engine), so
 * the id, the mirror entry and the held-row key are the real ones. The hold is a RECORD in the jar
 * — what a browser holds after a lost answer, the arm `parkedComposeRecord` reads. Since the discard
 * of a held row was admitted, a record no longer refuses the press: the server decides and the
 * record is RELEASED on confirm, which is what this file measures. The `sending` refusal is driven
 * in `discard-decision.test.ts`, its rendering in the verbs test.

   * fixture failed on `expected 'demo-1' not to be 'demo-1'`.
   *
   * So the conditional is pinned as source, beside the case that drives the guard itself, and the
   * pairing is stated: the case above proves the guard refuses and admits; this proves it is asked
   * about the right message. `holdOf`'s own answer for a row a record does not name is driven in
   * the census's truth table against a literal mirror.
