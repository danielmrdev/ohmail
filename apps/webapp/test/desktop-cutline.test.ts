/**
 * THE DESKTOP NEVER ENGAGED THE CUTLINE, AND THE GATE THAT STOPPED IT WAS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
 *
 * `AppShell` refuses to partition until `consent.known` is true, and the reason it gives is
 * about a STORED window it has not read yet: *"partitioning on a guessed window would move mail
 * out of the piles and into History on the strength of a default the account may not be using,
 * and a request that simply failed would silently hide somebody's mail."* Both halves of that
 * presuppose a server holding a number.
 *
 * A standalone install has no server and no stored number. `apiConfigured()` is false, so
 * `useConsentState` never issues its fetch, so `known` is false for the life of the process —
 * and the shell read that as "the answer has not arrived yet" and switched the whole cutline off.
 * The consequences are not a miscount:
 *
 *   · **NO HISTORY PILE AT ALL.** History's contents come from `consentView.history`, and there
 *     was no `consentView`. Every sender who went quiet years ago sat in the Screener queue
 *     instead, for ever — the long-queue shape `screener-cutline.test.ts` measured on the
 *     web, with nothing to correct it.
 *   · **A CONSENTED SENDER WAS ASKED ABOUT AGAIN**, because the queue grouped by the folder the
 *     mail server holds their backlog in rather than by the decision on record.
 *   · **#116's PAST-THE-GATE BRANCH WAS INERT.** It fires on a row the projection marked
 *     `gatePhysical:false`, and nothing was projected, so a sender whose mail is only in the
 *     INBOX had no row anywhere but search.
 *
 * The fix is one condition: a build with no consent surface engages the cutline on
 * `DEFAULT_DORMANCY_DAYS`, which is not a default standing in for the truth there — it is the
 * only window that build has, and the one the engine uses unasked.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE CLEARS `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * That variable IS the signal. `api-client.ts` reads it once at module load into `API_BASE`, and
 * `apiConfigured()` is the shared shell's one way to ask "is there a server behind this build" —
 * the same question `AutoOptInControl.supported` and the drafter's `unavailable` branch ask. On
 * the desktop the whole module is replaced by `apps/desktop/src/no-api-client.ts`, whose
 * `apiConfigured` answers `false` outright. Clearing the variable reproduces that answer through
 * the real module, which is the closest a jsdom mount gets to the shipped bundle.
 *
 * The engine is handed in for the same reason the desktop hands one in: with no API base
 * `createEngine` THROWS rather than fall back to fixtures, so there is no such thing as a live
 * browser tab in this state. Which is also why the web path cannot reach the new condition —
 * `screener-cutline.test.ts` holds the other direction.
