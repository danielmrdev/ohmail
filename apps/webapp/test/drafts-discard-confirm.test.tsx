/**
 * THE DISCARD QUESTION SITS WHERE THE HAND IS, AND MUST NOT EAT THE DRAFT. Twice wrong: a confirm
 * at `flex: 1 0 100%` beside the draft collapsed it to its padding (measured in Chromium); the fix
 * moved it into its own grid track — sentence and buttons at the far LEFT below the list while
 * Discard sat at the far RIGHT (as reported). Now the confirm REPLACES the action area at
 * the trailing edge, Escape is Keep, the draft keeps a 12rem basis, the confirm has `flex: 0 0
 * auto` with `max-width: 100%` and the confirming row's line wraps — the collapse made
 * unrepresentable, measured again by `kit/drafts/drafts-row-walk.mjs`. jsdom lays nothing out, so
 * the stylesheet is read as source (`readFileSync`, the `screener-row-actions-overlay` idiom).
