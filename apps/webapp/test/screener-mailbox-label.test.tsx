 * The Junk pane in the same view has always been per-mailbox;
 * this queue could not answer the question at all. The resolver is the shell's own
 * `mailboxLabelResolver` — the one the Reads view already takes — driven here rather than a
 * `() => "Work"` stub, so the `> 1` gate inside it is part of what is measured: a mount that
 * brought its own resolver would measure the test's function, not the product's.
 *
 * The needles are RENDERED output — the badge's text and the sheet's sentence — never a prop or
