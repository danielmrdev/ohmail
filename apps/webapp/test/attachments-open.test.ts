/**
 * ═══ GAP A PRESS BECOMES A FILE, AND THE BYTES ARE LET GO ═══════════════════════════
 *
 * `attachments-wired.test.ts` proves the LIVE engine can fetch. This proves the last ten
 * centimetres, in a real DOM, because every one of them is invisible to a test that drives
 * the engine directly:
 *
 *  · **The re-render.** Attachment state is in-memory only — nothing is written to the
 *    mirror — so `engine.read().version()` does not move when a fetch completes. A surface
 *    subscribed through `useEngineVersion` would sit on `idle` for ever while the bytes
 *    arrived behind it, and the engine's own suite would be perfectly green. That is this
 *    slice's failure mode one layer up, and it is what the first group here bites on.
 *  · **The release.** A `blob:` URL pins its bytes until it is revoked. Selecting away
 *    without revoking reintroduces, inside the browser, exactly the cost that "ohmail stores
 *    no attachment bytes" exists to avoid.
 *  · **The save.** The engine mints a URL; nothing in it puts a file on a disk.
 *
 * `document.createElement` is not stubbed. The anchor is built, clicked and removed for real,
 * and the assertions read the element the browser was actually handed — a mock of
 * `createElement` would let a wrong `download` attribute pass.
