/**
 * ═══ THE INVITE SURFACES ON THE MANAGED BUILD: STRUCTURALLY ABSENT ══════════════════════════
 *
 * The compiled half of the flavor gate, in its own file because the flavor is inlined at module
 * load — one flavor per process, exactly as one flavor per bundle (`user-invites.test.tsx`
 * carries the self-host half). NO flavor is set here, which IS the managed build: the
 * `OHMAIL_FLAVOR` arm only exists on the self-host compose.
 *
 * Two absences, each pinned at the strongest observable:
 *
 *  1. **`useUserInvites` answers false WITHOUT asking `/hello`** — even against a server
 *     scripted to announce `features.pairing: true`. The managed API mounts no `/pair` mint
 *     routes (an invite redeem there would bypass the billing funnel), so a managed tab that
 *     asked "may I show the pane?" would be paying a round trip for a question whose answer is
 *     compiled. The wire assertion is what the recorded mutation cannot pass: forcing
 *     `SELF_HOST_BUILD` true in `app/hello.ts` makes this case red twice over (a `/hello`
 *     leaves, and the hook flips on).
 *  2. **`/join/invite` is a 404** — `notFound()`, thrown before the screen exists. Nothing on
 *     managed ever mints a link of this shape; a live page there would be a form whose submit
 *     can only bounce. Mutation: forcing the page's flavor constant true turns this case red.
