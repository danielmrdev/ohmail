/**
 * THE DESKTOP SYNC-VISIBILITY FLAG — off by default, on only under a desktop build.
 *
 * `startSyncScheduler` drops to the slow hidden cadence (one drain a minute, no wake stream)
 * when `document.visibilityState` is `hidden` — it was ZERO syncs before the realtime-wake
 * slice; the flag's job is unchanged by that reversal. A desktop WINDOW the OS composites out
 * of view reads `hidden` too, which would silently slow a mail client that is supposed to stay
 * current in the background — so the desktop build passes the scheduler's `visibility: null`
 * seam to opt out of the visibility model. That must happen ONLY in a desktop build.
 *
 * This is the positive gate the brief calls for: if the flag ever leaked into the web build, the
 * default case below would go red. The desktop half — that `apps/desktop/vite.config.ts` sets the
 * flag — is asserted in `apps/desktop/test/desktop-shell.test.ts`.
