/**
 * ═══ GAP THE SCREEN A HUNG READ DRAWS ════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * An earlier change gave the LIST a state and made a refusal say so. A request that never answers is not a
 * refusal: nothing rejects, nothing carries a status, and the engine's outcome stays
 * `{state: "loading"}` — which `AttachmentStrip` renders as `null`, on purpose, because the read
 * is one indexed row and a skeleton on every message open would be noise. So the honest choice
 * for a fast read is the silent one for a hung read, and there is nothing in between.
 *
 * This file drives the REAL path — a real `HttpAdapter` over a `fetch` that never settles, a real
 * `OhmailEngine`, the real hook, the real component, wired the way `MessagePane` wires them. The
 * bound lives in the adapter (it is the only layer that can abort), so a fake `listAttachments`
 * would prove nothing here: it would hang after the fix exactly as it hangs before it.
 *
 * The engine half is `packages/client-engine/test/attachments-list-timeout.at8.test.ts`.
