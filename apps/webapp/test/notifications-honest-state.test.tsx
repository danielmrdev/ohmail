/**
 * SETTINGS → NOTIFICATIONS — THE PANE MAY NOT CLAIM MORE THAN THE PLATFORM ALLOWS.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE USED TO HOLD DOWN, AND WHY IT CHANGED ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It used to assert the pane rendered NO switches and one sentence saying delivery did not
 * exist. That was right at the time and is wrong now: delivery exists, so the sentence would be
 * the lie. Its own header named the consumer — "the slice that wires `Notification`
 * .requestPermission + a real subscription … rewrites this file to hold THAT down" — and this is
 * that rewrite. The demo-world assertions below are unchanged.
 *
 * It also carried a claim that has since gone stale and is corrected here rather than repeated:
 * that no worker read `push_subscriptions` and that there was "no web-push sender anywhere in
 * the repository". `apps/worker/src/push-wake.ts` is one, with its own content-free census.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT HOLDS DOWN NOW ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One rule, in four platform states: **no switch may claim ON while the OS draws nothing.**
 * A control whose ON position means nothing is the defect this pane WAS, and it does not come
 * back through a permission the pane forgot to read.

   * the master switch COULD NOT BE TURNED ON and nothing said why. Three presses, frames at
   * 0.3 s and 3 s, and the switch stayed off with no sentence anywhere on the pane. The web
   * build in the comparable state says "This device is set to refuse notifications from ohmail.
   * That is changed in the system settings, not here." — the desktop had no equivalent.
   *
   * The cause was the DEFAULT host: the desktop fell back to the browser reader, whose
   * `Notification.requestPermission()` resolves in that webview without granting anything, so
   * `pressMaster` took its `state !== "granted"` arm and wrote nothing. It was reporting a
   * refusal that had not happened, for a permission the page does not hold.

   * ── HOW TO WATCH THESE FAIL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   *  · delete the `osHoldsPermission` note from `SettingsView` → "says who has the last word"

   *    two sentences making different promises about the same state;
   *  · make `desktopNotificationHost.request()` answer "default" → "the press is written" goes
   *    red with the switch stuck off, which is the released behaviour;
   *  · put "switches below" back in `notifyMasterWhy` → "the master sentence does not promise"
