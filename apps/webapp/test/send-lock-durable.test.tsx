 * ONE PRESS IS ONE DELIVERY, ACROSS A RELOAD — the send lock's kill test.
 *
 * ## THE DEFECT
 *
 * `queued`, `inFlight` and `locked` are all `useRef`, and the file's
 * own comment records why `locked` had to leave React state: two presses in one tick each minted an
 * Idempotency-Key and each delivered. **The same argument applies one level up and was not made
 * there.** A ref does not survive a reload either. Reload inside the queued window and the durable
 * outbox replays the send under its original key (correct), while the restored composer — the
 * scratch draft is in `localStorage` and is cleared only when the UI observes a confirmation —
 * comes up `idle`. The next press minted a SECOND key, and a second key is a different key:
 * `idempotency_keys` cannot replay it and `outbound_sends UNIQUE (account_id, idempotency_key)`
 * cannot collapse it. The same mail is delivered twice to a real person — the one outcome in this
 * application that cannot be rolled back.
 *
 * ## THE HARNESS IS A SERVER, NOT A SPY
 *
 * The adapter models the half of `SendService` this is actually about: a key it has already
 * delivered under is REPLAYED, never re-sent (`resumeExisting`), and a key whose attempt failed
 * reserves nothing. `deliveries` therefore counts real mail leaving, not requests made — which is
 * the number the invariant is about and the only one worth asserting.
 *
 * ## THE FAILURE THIS FIX COULD HAVE OPENED, AND THE CASE THAT SHOWS IT DID NOT
 *
 * A lock bound to the LANE alone would be bound to `"compose"` plus a null draft id — the identity
 * of every compose this browser will ever write. Crash between the mint and the terminal outcome,
 * write a NEW message, press Send, and the stale key is resumed: the server replays the FIRST
 * send's result, the editor reads `confirmed`, clears the scratch, says "Sent." — and the new
 * message was never sent. **A silently unsent mail is worse than the duplicate.** The third case
 * drives exactly that sequence and asserts the second message goes out under a key of its own.

     * message carries a row the record's fingerprint was not computed with, so a fingerprint
     * comparison unlocks it. Recorded because a mutation note nobody watched is a claim, and this
