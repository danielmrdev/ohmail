/**
 * ═══ THE THREAD'S LISTS ARE LOADED, NOT ONLY THE FOCUSED MESSAGE'S ═════════════════════════
 *
 * The found defect (a live account): the reader's own SENT reply — worker-ingested from the
 * Sent folder, two files extracted and stamped server-side — rendered inside its open thread
 * with no attachments anywhere, because the strip's data has to be ASKED for
 * (`engine.loadAttachments` fills state that `itemsOf` merely reads) and the only asker was
 * keyed on the SELECTED id. Every sibling's list sat at the silent default for the life of the
 * view. `MessageCard` now renders the strip (held by `conversation.test.ts`); this file holds
 * the other half — that somebody actually asks — against the REAL hook over a REAL engine.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ASKER IS THE HOOK AND NOT THE CARD ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The card is mounted twice while the reader is open (the mounted-twice rule the whole message
 * chrome exists for), so a card-owned ask would need a card-owned release, and an unmount-time
 * release from one mount revokes object URLs the other mount is still showing. One owner —
 * `useMessageAttachments`, mounted once in `AppShell` — asks for the whole conversation and
 * releases the whole conversation.
 *
 * ── THE TWO LIFECYCLE TRAPS PINNED HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. A WITHIN-thread selection move keeps the same conversation ids, so an effect keyed on
 *     the id list alone would never re-run — while the selected-id effect's cleanup has already
 *     released everything. The re-ask after such a move is asserted below.
 *  2. Selecting AWAY must release every list the selection asked for — the focused message AND
 *     the siblings — or a session spent reading threads accumulates every fetched byte for the
 *     life of the tab (the "ohmail stores no attachment bytes" cost, rebuilt in the browser).
