/**
 * B.3 GUARD — HYDRATE ON VIEWPORT INTENT, NOT THE PILE.
 *
 * Reads rendered the raw text dump because the cards' bodies were never fetched. The fix hydrates
 * a card as it nears the fold — one IntersectionObserver in `StreamShell`, `onNear` wired to
 * `hydrateBody` — and it MUST stay per-card: a pile-wide prefetch is exactly the API cost with no
 * revenue behind it that the "No API cost without revenue behind it" invariant forbids.
 *
 * jsdom has no real IntersectionObserver, so this stubs one that DELIVERS every observed card but
 * marks only the first N as `isIntersecting`. The near effect filters on `isIntersecting`, so a
 * correct implementation hydrates exactly those N and never the seen tail. Mutate the effect to
 * fire for every delivered entry (drop the `isIntersecting` check / "loop all") and the seen-tail
 * assertion goes red — the guard is watched, not decorative.
