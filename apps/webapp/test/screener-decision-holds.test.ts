/**
 * A SCREENING DECISION HOLDS WHILE YOU MOVE AROUND THE APP — and a refusal is never silent.
 *
 * ## THE REPORT
 *
 * *"Screened one sender in and one out, went to the Ohbox, came back — both were back as if
 * undecided."*
 *
 * ## WHAT WAS RULED OUT FIRST, so nobody re-walks it
 *
 * The pending map does NOT die on unmount (it is a ref in `useScreenerState`, which lives in
 * `AppShell`, above the view). The route change DOES flush pending commits (`AppShell`'s
 * route-transition effect calls `screener.flush()`). The desktop door DOES carry the screener
 * routes. And the message DTO reports `desiredFolder` FIRST (`dto/materialize.ts` —
 * `fs?.desiredFolder ?? loc?.folder`), so a decide's folder change is on the wire immediately and
 * does not wait for the worker's IMAP move. Every one of those is fine, and the first case below
 * proves it end-to-end against a faithful server: decide in, decide out, leave, return, both hold.
 *
 * ## THE MECHANISM THAT ACTUALLY PRODUCED IT
 *
 * `screener-state.ts#commit` fired `void engine.mutate({kind:"screener_decide", …})` and never
 * looked at the result. `screener_decide` answers `changes: []`, so the engine drops the optimistic
 * overlay on confirm and the settled facts arrive from a reconciliation drain — but on a REFUSAL it
 * drops the overlay too and reports `rolled_back` to a caller that had thrown the promise away.
 * Nothing restored the row deliberately, nothing marked it, nothing said anything: the sender was
 * simply back in the queue, byte-identical to never having been decided.
 *
 * The live trigger is the server's own 404. `POST /screener/:id` resolves through `heldRowById`,
 * which requires `desired_folder = 'ohmail/Screener'`, so any row this mirror still believes is at
 * the gate while the server has already moved it on — a second device, the retro pass walking a
 * backlog after an `applyRetro` rule — is refused. That is one stale poll interval wide and it hits
 * every decision made inside it, which is why BOTH senders came back together.
 *
 * ## THE HARNESS
 *
 * A `/sync` world that applies the decide server-side the way the service does (re-route the
 * sender's held mail to the chosen folder, promote a rule, record both at fresh seqs) and serves
 * changes after the client's cursor. `refuseDecide` flips it to the 404. The controls driven are
 * the per-row quick-adjust menu — `.scn-act-more` then the nth `.scn-act-dest` — deliberately NOT
 * any bulk "apply suggestions" chip: those apply the MODEL's destination to every waiting row, so a
 * harness that reaches one by text match silently decides for the wrong senders and proves nothing.
