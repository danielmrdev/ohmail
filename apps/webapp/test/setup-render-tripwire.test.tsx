/**
 * ═══ A RENDER LOOP MUST FAIL BY NAME, NOT BY CLOCK ═════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A frontend fix planted a true update loop in the composer twice and got the same reading
 * both times: the file ran past four minutes to the suite's timeout with NO assertion reached, and
 * a render counter placed inside the tree never fired, because React's own "Maximum update depth
 * exceeded" lands in `ViewBoundary` — which is exactly what that boundary is for. The lane removed
 * its tripwire rather than ship a guard it had watched not fire, and filed the row.
 *
 * The two loops behave differently and the arms keep them apart. A LAYOUT-effect loop is bounded
 * by React at fifty nested updates, so it ends — inside the boundary, with the fallback painted
 * and nothing named. A PASSIVE-effect loop is not bounded at all: written here without the
 * tripwire it took a vitest worker to an out-of-memory death at 120 s, which is the reading this
 * guard replaces, so it is driven only through the tripwire.
