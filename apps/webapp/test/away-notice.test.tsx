/**
 * THE AWAY RESPONDER'S OHBOX NOTICE — the tell for the one state in which this product sends
 * mail on its own.
 *
 * The responder shipped with a sender, an audience, a suppression set and a Settings control —
 * and no surface on the pane its owner actually reads, so "mail is being answered for you" was
 * invisible outside Settings → Screener. The notice is one quiet line in the Ohbox header, held
 * by the SHELL (one `GET /away-responder` per tab, never one per Ohbox visit) and rendered
 * through `OhboxView`'s `standingNotice` slot — the list's first block, inside the scroller.
 *
 * ── WHAT MUST BE TRUE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. RESPONDER ON → THE NOTICE RENDERS, and its sentence matches the stored AUDIENCE. The
 *     copy is a claim about who is answered, and the two audiences answer different people —
 *     one sentence for both would be false for one of them.
 *  2. RESPONDER OFF → NOTHING. No placeholder, no empty strip.
 *  3. NO SERVER TO ASK → NOTHING, AND NO READ IS EVEN ISSUED. The hook's gate is the same one
 *     the settings row lives behind (`autoOptIn.supported`); a standalone install draws
 *     nothing and asks nothing. Mutating the gate makes the no-fetch assertion red, because
 *     the stub is deliberately primed with an ENABLED responder.
 *  4. THE SETTINGS ROW'S SAVE ECHO FLIPS THE NOTICE IN THE SAME TAB — the seam that keeps the
 *     one-read-per-tab design honest for the person most likely to look: the one who just
 *     turned it on.
 *  5. THE AFFORDANCE LANDS ON THE PANE THAT CONTROLS IT — Settings, the responder's OWN pane, via
 *     the `?settings=<pane>` deep link `initialPaneFromUrl` reads at mount.
 *  6. The shell wiring itself is pinned by source, the way `demo-gate.test.ts` pins the
 *     ceremony panes: the gate is a ternary at the OhboxView call site in `AppShell`, and a
 *     probe here cannot notice that ternary being edited away.

 * BEFORE ANY IMPORT OF `api-client`: `API_BASE` is a module-level `const` read ONCE at load

 * statement here is NOT early enough, because ESM evaluates every `import` above the module
 * body: the `PANE_IDS` import above reaches `api-client` transitively, so it captured
 * `API_BASE = null` and `useAwayNotice` then declined to read at all.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical — it is what this file did between (which added the
 * `PANE_IDS` assertion) and the fix. The four cases that require the notice to RENDER went red
 * while the two that assert its ABSENCE stayed green **vacuously**, which is why it read as
 * four defects instead of one broken precondition.
 *
