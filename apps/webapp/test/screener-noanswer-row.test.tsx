/**
 * ═══ A ROW THE RUN COULD NOT ANSWER FOR SAYS SO — NEVER "→ No answer 0.00" ════════════════
 *
 * MEASURED (a reported screenshot, de locale, 2026-09-19; production read-only the same day): every
 * waiting sender a stopped run had not answered for wore "→ Keine Antwort 0.00" — the non-answer
 * LABEL rendered as a destination chip, over a confidence that measured nothing — while the
 * header said "All N senders have a suggestion" against filter chips reading "No suggestion N".
 * The cause on the account was real (`spend_unavailable`: the plane refuses a canceled
 * subscription's spend); the client's rendering of it was the defect.
 *
 * Three claims:
 *
 *  1. A `noAnswer` row renders ONE PLAIN SENTENCE (`aiSkipRow.*`) — no arrow, no number.
 *  2. The partition has ONE spelling (`hasRealSuggestion`): the apply button's count and the
 *     filter chips' groups come from the same predicate. Mutating that selector to admit a
 *     `noAnswer` row reddens the agreement assertion here — watched red while building this
 *     (the apply count moved to 5; the chips followed), then restored.
 *  3. The suggest control's resting sentence may claim "all N have a suggestion" only when NO
 *     waiting sender is in the chips' "none" group (`unanswered === 0`).
