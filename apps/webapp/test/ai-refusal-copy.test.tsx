/**
 * AN ENGLISH SENTENCE ON A GERMAN SCREEN, ABOUT A STATE THE ACCOUNT WAS NOT IN
 *
 * The Screener card read "no AI credits remain on this account" — in English, on a German UI —
 * and was still reading it the next morning, on an account that had been spending in between.
 * Two defects in one sentence: the words were the server's, written for a log, and the line had
 * no way to come down short of a press. The fact a refusal carries is its `code`; the sentence
 * for it belongs to the catalogue, and a line claiming something about an account is re-asked
 * against that account.
