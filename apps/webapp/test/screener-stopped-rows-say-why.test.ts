/**
 * ═══ A SENDER A STOPPED RUN NEVER REACHED SAYS WHY, NOT "YET" ═════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS ON SCREEN, MEASURED (managed plane, 2026-09-10, read-only) ───────────────────
 *
 * A run that stops on the spend gate returns suggestions for the senders it reached and
 * NOTHING for the rest, so every unreached row fell back to `screener.noSuggestion` —
 * "No suggestion yet for this sender." On an account whose subscription had been canceled for
 * seventeen days, most of its waiting senders showed that sentence: a promise the account
 * cannot keep, with the real fact ("AI is switched off for this account") arriving only as a
 * one-off toast under the batch that discovered it.
 *
 * The per-row vocabulary already existed — `screener.aiSkip.*`, rendered off
 * `suggestion.noAnswer` — and `toSkips` already used it for the senders the SERVER named. What
 * was missing is the senders it did not name because it stopped before reaching them.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ASKED LIST AND NOT "EVERY WAITING SENDER" ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A stop is a fact about the ACCOUNT, so the temptation is to paint every row. The buy list is
 * what this run actually asked about; a sender outside it was never a question, and answering
 * for them would be this client stating a refusal nobody has tested against that sender's mail.
 *
 * ── MUTATIONS WATCHED (each restored, `cmp`-proven) ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  · `if (!res.stopped) return [];` → `return [];`  ⇒ both stop cases RED.
 *  · drop the `answered` filter                      ⇒ "a sender the run DID answer" RED.
 *  · lower-case comparison removed                   ⇒ "case does not matter" RED.
