/**
 * THE SCREENER'S READ COLUMN OPENS ON THE LATEST HELD MESSAGE — the arithmetic, guarded.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT A MOUNTED TEST ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Held mail renders oldest→newest, so a fresh render sits on the OLDEST message while the consent
 * decision a person is about to take is about the newest. The effect in `ScreenerView` scrolls the
 * `.scn-read` column so the last `.hmail` sits at the top, and until now nothing anywhere asserted
 * the offset it computes — the whole behaviour rested on one three-term expression written once.
 *
 * It cannot be asserted from a mounted view: jsdom implements no layout, so every
 * `getBoundingClientRect` is a zero rect and `scrollTop` never moves. A test that rendered
 * `ScreenerView` and asserted "the column scrolled" would be green for a correct formula, green for
 * a formula missing a term, and green for no formula at all. That is why the arithmetic was
 * extracted: the guard has to drive the numbers.
 *
 * ── THE MUTATIONS THESE TESTS WERE WATCHED FAILING UNDER ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each case below fails under a DIFFERENT plausible rewrite, which is what makes the set worth more
 * than one assertion:
 *
 *  · dropping `+ scrollTop` — the version that works only from the top of an unscrolled column, and
 *    therefore works on the first sender you select and not on any after it. Caught by
 *    "already scrolled";
 *  · dropping `- readTop` — treats the message's VIEWPORT position as its content offset, so the
 *    error is exactly the column's distance from the top of the window. Caught by "the column is
 *    not at the top of the window";
 *  · dropping `Math.max(0, …)` — a negative target, which the DOM silently coerces to 0. Correct by
 *    accident, and the clamp is what makes it correct on purpose. Caught by "the first message in a
 *    short list";
 *  · dropping `- pad` — the anchored message flush against the column edge. Caught by every case.
