/**
 * ═══ A SETTINGS FLIP ON ANOTHER SURFACE REACHES THIS ONE, LIVE — no restart, no reload ═══════
 *
 * The measured defect (owner, live): disabling folders on the web left the desktop showing the
 * folders group — a "no folders" husk over tombstoned entities — until the app was restarted.
 * The consent answer was read once at boot; folder ENTITIES synced, the SETTING did not.
 *
 * The propagation seam, end to end through the SHIPPED shell:
 *
 *  · every consent-settings writer appends a `settings` change row in its own transaction
 *    (`packages/services/test/settings-sync.test.ts`), which rings the wake at commit;
 *  · the row arrives in this client's mirror on the next drain — here, via the driven `/sync`;
 *  · `AppShell` reads the record's `updatedAt` as a stamp and `useConsentState` re-asks
 *    `GET /consent` on every stamp transition — the live read stays the authority;
 *  · the rail re-renders from the fresh answer: the group DISAPPEARS on a flip to off (never
 *    the husk), and APPEARS on a flip to on.
 *
 * Both directions of the cross-surface story land on this same seam: a flip made on the web
 * writes the hosted row whose change the DESKTOP mirror re-emits locally
 * (`apps/sidecar/test/cloud-mirror-settings.test.ts`), and a flip made on the desktop is
 * FORWARDED to the same hosted writer (`apps/desktop/test/desktop-cloud-settings.test.tsx`)
 * whose change reaches this browser's own drain — which is exactly what is driven here.
 *
 * The third render is pinned too: with the flag ON and ZERO folder entities, an unsettled
 * mirror shows SKELETON rows — "no folders on your mail server yet" is a sentence only a
 * settled mirror may say.
