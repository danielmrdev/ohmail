/**
 * THE SCREENER NEVER SAYS "BUY".
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS ON SCREEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The suggestion control shipped in the vocabulary of a shop: "Buying suggestions…",
 * "{done} of {total} bought…", "Bought 12 of 40", "Nothing to buy here", "…credits spent",
 * "ohmail buys a suggestion for the first 10 senders". Nine strings, one metaphor, and it is
 * the wrong one — a person pressing this is not making a purchase, they are asking their own
 * mailbox a question against an allowance they have already paid for. A monthly plan's credits
 * are a budget, not a wallet, and copy that says "buy" turns every press into a transaction the
 * reader has to feel careful about. The feature is advice; the noun is a suggestion.
 *
 * ── WHY A GUARD RATHER THAN A CORRECTED FILE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The word came back once already — the strings were rewritten and `autoCost` kept "buys the
 * next few", because a sweep by eye reads the block it is looking at and not the one four keys
 * later. A regex over the whole namespace does not get tired. This is the assertion that
 * survives the next person adding a string in a hurry.
 *
 * ── THE SPEND INVARIANT IS UNTOUCHED, AND THE DOCBLOCKS STILL SAY "BUY" ──────────────────
 *
 * This is a rename in the COPY, and deliberately not in the code that moves money.
 * `screener-suggest.ts` documents a spend rule — "credits are never moved without an action
 * that named the cost first" — and its comments keep the blunt verb precisely because they are
 * about the money and not about the reader. A guard that reached into source comments would be
 * asking the implementation to describe itself in the user's words, which is how an invariant
 * loses the sentence that makes it checkable.
 *
 * ── RED-FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Watched to fail: restoring `"running": "Buying suggestions…"` in `messages/en.json` turns the
 * first case below red naming `screener.suggest.running`. Watched again with the word buried in
 * `autoCost`, which is the one the manual sweep missed.
 */

/**
 * `\b(buy|…)` with NO trailing boundary, so the inflections are covered by the stems: "buys",
 * "buying", "purchases", "purchased" all match. A trailing `\b` would let "buys" through, which
 * is the exact form the missed string used.
