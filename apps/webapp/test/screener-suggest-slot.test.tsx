/**
 * WHICH SUGGEST CONTROL THE SCREENER SHOWS, AND WHAT IT IS ALLOWED TO SAY.
 *
 * This view is compiled into a browser tab and into the desktop app, and the two are not asking the
 * same question. A hosted account buys suggestions out of an allowance, so its control names a
 * price before it spends. A standalone install has no account and no allowance — the model belongs
 * to whoever set it up — so a price there is not a different number, it is an invented one. The
 * desktop therefore brings its OWN control and hands it in.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because nothing was watching. Deleting the suggest control from the Screener outright — the whole
 * `suggest` prop, on every host — left the entire webapp suite green. A surface whose disappearance
 * no test notices is a surface that can disappear, and the two claims below are the ones a person
 * would actually miss:
 *
 *  1. THE HOSTED CONTROL STILL NAMES ITS PRICE. It is on screen, and the number on it is the
 *     server's quote — the whole reason that flow has a dry run in the middle of it.
 *  2. THE HANDED-IN CONTROL REPLACES IT, and the price vocabulary goes with it. Never both, because
 *     two controls over one queue is two ways to ask one question with different words on them.
