/**
 * "SEARCHING THE WHOLE ARCHIVE…" HAD NO END — the failure-looks-like-healthy family, on screen.
 *
 * What was reported: a query answered "Nothing on this device. … Searching the whole archive…"
 * and that second sentence never resolved. The archive was not the problem — `search-punctuation.pg.test.ts`
 * measures the same subject matching `websearch_to_tsquery` against real Postgres, and it does.
 * The problem was that `searching` was a state only a SETTLED promise could replace: a request
 * that never settles left the sentence up for the rest of the session, and a reader has no way
 * to tell that from a slow archive.
 *
 * A searching state can no longer outlive its request. The ceiling is
 * {@link ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT_MS} and it renders a sentence that says what happened, with the retry
 * this view already offers for a refusal.
 *
 * The stub here never settles — which is the production shape of the fault, not an error: a
 * rejection was always rendered (`scopeFailed`), and this is the case that was not.
