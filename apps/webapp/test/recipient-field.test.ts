/**
 * THE RECIPIENT FIELD — chips over one wire string.
 *
 * The rule: recipients must ALWAYS be editable — removable one at a time, addable by typing,
 * draggable within and between rows, movable by keyboard. The value stays ONE comma-separated
 * string (`ComposeFields.to`'s shape), so the guards here are about the two directions of that
 * bijection and about the envelope:
 *
 *  1. WHAT THE CHIPS DO TO THE STRING. Removing a chip, committing the tail, accepting a
 *     suggestion and moving a chip between rows must each change the string — because the
 *     string is what `composePlan` builds the SMTP envelope from. Several assertions below
 *     therefore end at `composePlan`/`parseRecipients`, not at the DOM: a chip UI that looks
 *     right and leaves the envelope unchanged is mail going to the wrong people.
 *  2. WHAT IT WRITES READS BACK. Accepting must produce something `parseRecipients` reads
 *     back as the address that was picked — otherwise the field looks right and the mail goes
 *     nowhere. (`packages/client-engine/test/address-book.test.ts` proves the ranking.)
