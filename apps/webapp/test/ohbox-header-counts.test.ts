/**
 * THE OHBOX HEADER SAYS WHAT IT COUNTS, AND NEVER THROWS THE NOUN AWAY.
 *
 * Reported live, from a real mailbox with most of its senders
 * held at the Screener. The strip rendered:
 *
 *     N unread of M
 *     K new senders waiting          ← clipped to "K new senders wait…"
 *     Screener ›
 *
 * Two failures, one of which is not a layout bug at all:
 *
 *  1. NEITHER LINE NAMED ITS NOUN. These are different quantities — mail sitting in the
 *     Ohbox versus senders held at the door — and at the reported sizes they are close
 *     enough in magnitude that two unlabelled numbers read as one number said twice. No
 *     amount of CSS fixes that; the strings had to change.
 *  2. The one noun that WAS there got clipped, because `doorbell.css:14` puts
 *     `white-space:nowrap; overflow:hidden; text-overflow:ellipsis` on `.db-txt`. An
 *     ellipsis always eats the END of the sentence, and the end of the sentence is where
 *     the noun lives. The tidier the truncation looked, the less the strip said.
 *
 * So the guards below assert the NOUNS and not the digits. A test that only checked for
 * the bare number would have passed against the reported screenshot.

/**
 * THE CLIPPING GUARD, and the one thing it cannot check.
 *
 * jsdom does not process `import "./doorbell.css"`, so the CSS is injected by hand — but
 * from the REAL files, never from a copy pasted in here, or this measures nothing.
 *
 * **jsdom's `getComputedStyle` cascades on SOURCE ORDER and ignores specificity.** Proven
 * while writing this file: two rules, `.view-ohbox .doorbell .db-txt` (0,3,0) first and
 * `.doorbell .db-txt` (0,2,0) second, resolved to the SECOND one's `white-space:nowrap`.
 * A real engine gives `normal`. So the injection below is in cascade order — the base
 * sheet, then the override — because that is the only order in which jsdom can express the
 * right answer, and `specificity()` below covers what it therefore cannot.
 *
 * Verified separately in Chrome at 390px with `app.css` linked BEFORE `doorbell.css` — the
 * adversarial order, where only specificity can save the override: `white-space:normal`,
 * `overflow:visible`, zero clipping ancestors. `next build` as of this slice happens to
 * emit the friendly order (`app-build-manifest.json` lists the `@ohmail/ui` chunk before
 * `app.css` for `(product)/layout`), but that is a bundler detail this repo does not
 * control — `doorbell.css` is imported by the component module and `app.css` by the route
 * group's layout — so an override that needed it would be a coin flip across builds.
