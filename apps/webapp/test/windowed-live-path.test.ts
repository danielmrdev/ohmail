/**
 * ═══ THE BROWSER'S MIRROR IS A WINDOW, ON THE PATH THE PRODUCT BUILDS ══════════════════════
 *
 * `StorePolicy` defaults to `full` — nothing is ever evicted — and that default is deliberate:
 * the desktop tier's whole promise is that the mail is on the device, so a host that configures
 * nothing must get today's behaviour rather than a quietly truncated mailbox. A policy that
 * pruned by omission would be data loss with no error message.
 *
 * The cost of that correct default is that the browser's window exists ONLY as one option on one
 * construction call, and **the risk it carries is one-sided and silent**. Drop the option and
 * nothing fails: the app compiles, every suite stays green, every pile renders, every drain
 * converges. The single symptom is a mirror that grows back to the whole mailbox — on somebody
 * else's machine, months later, until IndexedDB's quota refuses a write nobody is watching for.
 *
 * There is no second guard behind this file. It is the only thing that fails when the option
 * goes, so it asserts the policy BEHAVIOURALLY, through the engine `createEngine` actually
 * builds, rather than by reading a field back.
 *
 * ── MUTATION-WATCHED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Removing `storePolicy: BROWSER_WINDOW` from `createEngine`'s live branch turns the first two
 * tests red (the ancient rows survive the drain). Changing `days` to 400 turns the first red on
 * its own. Both were watched, then the implementation was restored.
