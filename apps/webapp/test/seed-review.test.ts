/**
 * THE SEED REVIEW SCREEN — the list is shown BEFORE it acts, and the button says what it does.
 *
 * Four claims, and each is one way this screen could be dishonest:
 *
 *   1. it names the people and the count before anything is written;
 *   2. it says out loud that confirming moves no mail — the promise most easily broken by an
 *      implementation that reused the Screener's decide path;
 *   3. the robot filter's removals are disclosed with their reasons, not hidden;
 *   4. the confirm posts exactly what is ticked, once, with an idempotency key.
 *
 * Mounted as the real component against a fetch mock, rather than through `AppShell`: the shell
 * decides WHEN to show it (that is `seedOwed`, and `history-view.test.ts` covers the shell's
 * partition), and what is under test here is what the screen itself says and sends.
