/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  THE SPLIT VIEWS' HALF OF THE FIRST-PRESS RULE
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `cursorless-first-press.test.tsx` proves the rule over the shell's own three lists. The verbs
 * seam (`message-verbs.ts`) is the other host: Folder, Tag and History mount it over a cursor the
 * shell cannot see, and it declared `disabledReason: "no_cursor"` with nothing behind it to
 * answer — the shell's placer holds no cursor for those routes and declines, so the press stayed
 * silent. Two things had to be true and neither could be seen from the other:
 *
 *   · the seam has to CLAIM a placer at all, over the rows and the selector the view hands it;
 *   · that claim has to BEAT the shell's, and the shell's is always the more recent one (React
 *     runs a child's effects before its parent's), which is what `PlacerScope` states.
 *
 * The host below is a view's shape and no more: rows with `.row[data-id]`, a cursor in local
 * state, and DELIBERATELY no `?? rows[0]` fallback — Folder, Tag and History each carry one, and
 * a fixture that copied it would place the cursor before the press and measure nothing. The seam
 * admits `shown: null` by its own contract, which is the state under test.
 *
 * ── HOW TO WATCH IT FAIL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   · drop `useRowCursorPlacer` from `message-verbs.ts` → every placing case reds;
 *   · claim it at `"global"` instead of `"view"` → the precedence case reds (the shell answers);
 *   · make the parked walk RUN the binding → "performs NOTHING" reds with a verb dispatched;
 *   · drop `placeFirstRow`'s standing-cursor or DOM-row refusal → the seam cases at the bottom
 *     red; neither is reachable through the dispatcher, which is why they are called directly;
 *· return `true` from `placeFirstRow` on an empty list → the empty-list case reds (on the
 *     keypress it swallows: with no rows, nothing else about the screen differs).
