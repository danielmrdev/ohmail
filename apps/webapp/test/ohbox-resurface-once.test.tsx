/**
 * A RESURFACED MESSAGE IS ONE ROW — through the OPTIMISTIC window, not only after a reload.
 *
 * "Resurface now" pins the row at the top immediately (the overlay writes the state and
 * `ohboxView` files it in the pinned group, held out of the other two). The props this view
 * receives therefore never contain the message twice — but the view's SESSION ORDERS did:
 * `reconcile`'s keep clause holds an id as long as any of the three groups still knows it, so
 * `newOrder` went on holding a row the pin had just claimed, and the message rendered twice —
 * pinned at the top AND in its old New slot — until a reload emptied the orders. The settled
 * state was always right, which is exactly why nothing caught it: every earlier test mounted
 * fresh. These tests re-render one live view across the transition, the way the shell does.
 *
 * The rule under guard: each session order agrees with the SELECTOR about which section owns an
 * id. Delete the prune (`.filter((id) => !pinnedIds.has(id))` on `newOrder`) and the duplicate
 * comes back — the first test goes red. Delete the release arm and a rolled-back pin strands or
 * doubles the row — the third test goes red.
