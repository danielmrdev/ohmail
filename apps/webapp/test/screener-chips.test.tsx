/**
 * THE SCREENER'S FILTER CHIPS — and the apply count they were built to make legible.
 *
 * "Apply 12 — Ohbox, News & Receipts" over a queue of nineteen is a true sentence that leaves
 * seven senders unaccounted for. It is true because the bulk deliberately refuses the senders the
 * model held or was never asked about — but nothing on screen said so, and a reader pressing it
 * had no way to find out which seven were being stepped over or where they had gone.
 *
 * So the two claims under test are the two halves of that fix:
 *
 *  1. THE COUNTS ARE THE STORE'S. The apply-able chips add up to `suggestedCount` exactly,
 *     and the chips that carry a number are exactly `suggestedDests`. Both are read off the live
 *     state object, so a chip derived from a second, drifting predicate goes red here rather
 *     than shipping a partition that disagrees with the button above it.
 *  2. THE FILTER IS A VIEW, NOT A DECISION. Pressing a chip narrows the list and touches
 *     nothing else — no mutation, no mirror write, and the queue's own counts are unmoved.
 *
 * SPAM IS ONE OF THE APPLY-ABLE CHIPS, and used to be part of the remainder. The bulk once refused
 * to file a spam verdict — which is what "it stops at the spam and shows one only the remaining
 * spam messages" looked like from the outside — and now files it like any other destination. The
 * chip is in the same place because both lists come from `APPLY_PILE_ORDER`; what changed is which
 * side of the sum it falls on, which is exactly what the first test measures.
 *
 * MUTATION WATCH — each of these was applied to `ScreenerView.tsx`, watched go red, and reverted
 * (2026-08-09):
 *   · `filterGroupOf` sending a hold and a `noAnswer` to the `screened` chip instead of `none`
 *     → the counts test.
 *   · `items` left unfiltered while a chip is pressed → the narrowing test.
 *   · `FilterChips`' `shown.length < 2` relaxed to `< 1` → the no-partition test.
