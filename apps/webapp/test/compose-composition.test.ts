/**
 * ═══ COMPOSE IS A PANEL WITH A HEAD, A MESSAGE AND A FOOT ═════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The pass this file guards is a composition, so the assertions are about STRUCTURE — which
 * element contains which — and not about a computed pixel. Two of the three are things a
 * screenshot cannot tell you and a CSS change cannot fake:
 *
 *  1. THE CC/BCC AFFORDANCE IS INSIDE THE `TO` ROW. It had a full-width strip of its own
 *     (`.c-ccbcc-row`) between To and Subject, which read as a fourth field and cost the form a
 *     band of vertical space to say one 11.5px word. Lifting the button back out of the row is
 *     exactly the mutation this catches: `closest(".c-field")` stops resolving to the To field
 *     and the first assertion goes red. A test that merely asked "is there a Cc/Bcc button"
 *     would pass against the shipped defect, which is why it asks WHERE.
 *
 *  2. IT STILL OPENS THE FIELDS. Moving a control is only safe if it still does its job, so the
 *     press is driven and both rows are read out of the DOM.
 *
 *  3. THE PANEL'S THREE REGIONS ARE IN ORDER AND THE FOOT IS LAST. `.compose-head`,
 *     `.compose-editor`, `.compose-foot` are direct children of `.compose-wrap` in that order,
 *     and Send and the status line are both inside the foot — which is what `margin-top: auto`
 *     acts on. Put SendStatus back outside the foot and the last assertion fails.
 *
 * Mounted through the shipped shell rather than by handing `ComposeView` props, for the reason
 * `compose-from.test.ts` gives about the From row: the defect this replaces was a working data
 * path with the wrong thing on screen, so the acceptance is the rendered surface.
