/**
 * A POLL THAT LEARNED NOTHING PUBLISHES NOTHING, AND A POLL THAT LEARNED SOMETHING THE PARTITION
 * DOES NOT CARE ABOUT DOES NOT REBUILD IT.
 *
 * Two seams, one cost. `GET /mailboxes` is re-read every thirty seconds and parses a fresh array
 * out of the wire each time, so `setFacts(got)` used to publish a NEW IDENTITY on every poll even
 * when every field was identical; and `ownAddresses` was keyed on that array, so it produced a new
 * value whenever ANY mailbox field moved — including `pendingMoves`, which decrements on every poll
 * for as long as the organizer has a backlog. `ownAddresses` is a dependency of `consentView`, so
 * either one rebuilt the whole-mirror consent partition and the projection over every message in
 * the mailbox. On a mailbox of a few thousand messages that is about a gigabyte an hour of retained memory
 * (the project's design notes).
 *
 * ── WHAT MAKES THIS CENSUS NON-VACUOUS, AND IT IS THREE THINGS ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. The probe resolves a STRUCTURALLY-CLONED copy per call. A probe handing back the same array
 *    would make the identity assertion true for a reason that has nothing to do with the gate.
 * 2. The partition must actually be running. `AppShell` returns `null` from `consentView` in demo
 *    mode, so a demo-mode census counts zero calls and passes green over a shell that derives
 *    nothing. This mounts the standalone (desktop) shape and asserts `placeOf.size` equals the
 *    message count BEFORE it counts anything.
 * 3. The `pendingMoves` case asserts BOTH halves: the facts identity is allowed to change (the
 *    equality gate must not swallow a real change), and the partition must not be rebuilt for it.
 *
 * ── MUTATIONS WATCHED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  · revert `MailStateProvider`'s `setFacts`/`setProbedFreshness` equality gate to `setFacts(got)`
 *    → "an unchanged answer keeps its identity" fails: two polls, two identities.
 *  · revert `ownAddresses` to `[facts, rememberedOwn]`
 *    → "a pendingMoves-only change does not rebuild the partition" fails: the spy counts a second
 *      call.
