/**
 * READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION — the live Trash window's defining property, measured at the door.
 *
 * The window shows mail the mirror has never held, and it must never change it: there is no
 * restore for a message whose origin folder nobody recorded, so ohmail choosing one would be
 * ohmail filing somebody else's mail. The server half carries the same argument and counts the
 * mirror tables around every read (`packages/api/src/trash-window.ts`, `trash-window.test.ts`).
 *
 * This file is the client half of that: the door's methods over a fetch double, the door's key
 * set, and the absence of any second transport. NO MODULE MOCK here on purpose — the real
 * `api()` runs, so what is asserted is what would go on the wire.
 *
 * MUTATIONS WATCHED (recorded in the lane's report): `{ method: "POST" }` on either read reddens
 * the first case; a third door key reddens the second; a bare `fetch()` in the hook reddens the
 * third.
