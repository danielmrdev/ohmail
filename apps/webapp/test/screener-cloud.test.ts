/**
 * THE SCREENER ON A CLOUD ACCOUNT — what the surface dispatches for a DERIVED
 * row, which is every row on a live account.
 *
 * `POST /screener/:id` takes `{ decision, dest, scope }` and resolves `:id` only against mail
 * still held in `ohmail/Screener`. All five destinations come out of that one call; only the
 * "& read" modifier is composed on top, as a `mark_seen` batch, because it is a flag and not a
 * folder. These assertions are on the MUTATIONS the engine's adapter receives, i.e. on what the
 * server would actually be asked to do.
 *
 * ── THIS HEADER USED TO DESCRIBE THE DEFECT AS THE DESIGN (SCR-READ) ─────────────────────
 *
 * It read: *"it takes `{ decision, scope }`, files a yes to INBOX and a no to
 * `ohmail/Screened` … so the surface composes the remainder out of `move`"*. That composition
 * did not survive contact with the server: `decide` reads its held rows outside its
 * transaction and writes `desired_folder` inside it, so a `move` landing in that window was
 * stamped back to the default. In use it left four `promoted → INBOX` rules and dozens of
 * bulletins in the Ohbox for senders admitted with **Reads**, under a toast that said their
 * mail was filed to Reads and that future mail would follow.
 *
 * Get this wrong in the obvious way — reuse the old "yes unless screened" mapping — and
 * marking a sender spam files their mail into the Ohbox on a paying account.

 * unruled (⇒ undecided), so the cutline PRESENTS them at the gate. A `screener_decide` on such a
 * rep is a no-op that claims success — `derivedScreenerEffects` returns nothing, so `Engine.mutate`
 * rolls it back with nothing sent and the wire would 404 it. The screen-in never committed, and the
 * sender was nowhere but search.
 *
 * The commit now re-reads the RAW mirror: a rep that only PRESENTS at the gate is routed through the
 * sender sheet's past-the-gate ladder — `rule_create` (destination INBOX) asking no past-mail answer
 * (ruled: the card files what it shows), AWAITED so the toast follows the server. These are the state-level guards; `sender-screening.test.ts`
 * pins the plan/dispatch pure functions this leans on.
