/**
 * ═══ THE MAILBOX-FACTS POLL BELONGS TO ONE ACCOUNT TOO ═════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `MailStateProvider` re-reads `GET /mailboxes` every thirty seconds, and it already had an
 * ownership test: an answer is published only when the ENGINE, the probe and the freshness probe
 * are still the ones the request was made for. That is exactly right for the switch it was
 * written for — the shell replaced the engine, so an answer about the old one may not be
 * published over the new one.
 *
 * It cannot see the case that costs mail. When somebody signs in as another account in a second
 * tab of the same profile, the API rewrites the cookie jar and NOTHING in this tree changes:
 * the same engine object, the same probe function, the same callbacks. The next poll therefore
 * asks under the new session, the identity comparison is trivially true, and the other account's
 * mailbox ids, addresses, sync state, errors and timestamps are published into this account's
 * sync strip and From selectors. Automatically, on a timer, with nobody pressing anything.
 *
 * So the identity that matters here is the SESSION's, and the mirror's sync gate already holds
 * it. What is pinned below: the poll is shown WORKING first (or the refusal proves nothing), and
 * then a rewritten jar stops both the asking and the publishing.
