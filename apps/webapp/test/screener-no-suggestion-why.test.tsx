/**
 * ═══ A WAITING SENDER WITH NO SUGGESTION SAYS WHY, AND "YET" IS ONE OF THREE ANSWERS ══════
 *
 * Every row with no advice rendered "No suggestion yet for this sender." On a measured queue that
 * was most of the rows, and the word is a promise: it says one is coming. It is not coming for
 * a sender whose mail is kept away from every model, and it is not coming on an account whose
 * spend is refused — a STANDING condition that reached the person once, as a toast under the batch
 * that discovered it, while every row went on promising.
 *
 * So the sentence is derived from the reason, and the three are told apart on screen:
 *   pending      — nobody has asked about this sender. The only "yet".
 *   unavailable  — a run stopped on the spend gate; the rows it never reached wait on that.
 *   no_auto_ai   — the representative is `no_ai`; the automatic pass never asks about it.
 *
 * The assertion reads `data-why`, the state, AND the rendered sentence — the state so the test is
 * not an assertion about wording, the sentence so a state with the wrong copy attached cannot pass.
 *
 * MUTATIONS WATCHED RED (each restored and `cmp`-verified):
 *   · `noSuggestionReason` returning `"pending"` unconditionally  → the `no_ai` and stopped cases;
 *   · dropping the `sender.noAi` arm                              → the `no_ai` case alone;
 *   · dropping `setStanding(stopped ?? null)` from the run        → the stopped case alone;
 *   · `screenerSegments` no longer deriving `noAi` from the rep    → the `no_ai` case alone.
