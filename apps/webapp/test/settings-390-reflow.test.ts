/**
 * SETTINGS AT 390 — THE RULES PANE MAY NOT SET THE SHEET'S WIDTH.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT, MEASURED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * At 390×844 the whole settings sheet panned horizontally to 604px the moment the Rules pane
 * held real rules: Change/Revoke, the filter pills and "Revoke all N" sat off-canvas with no
 * affordance, and the section nav stretched with the sheet so the active "Rules" pill was
 * itself off-screen. Every other pane reflowed fine.
 *
 * The mechanism (bisected in a live browser against the production demo, 2026-08-12, by
 * toggling one candidate rule at a time):
 *
 *   `.rules-item .what` / `.meta` are `white-space: nowrap`, so a rule row's MIN-CONTENT
 *   width is the width of its longest unwrappable sentence. That intrinsic width propagates
 *   up through the list into the `.set-pane`, and the pane is a GRID ITEM of `.set-layout`,
 *   whose `1fr` track means `minmax(auto, 1fr)` — and the `auto` minimum of a grid item with
 *   `min-width: auto` is its min-content size. So one long rule address widened the TRACK,
 *   the track widened the nav sitting in it, and the sheet panned. `min-width: 0` anywhere
 *   INSIDE the pane changes nothing (measured: pane stayed 527px); it has to be on the grid
 *   items themselves, which is the rule this file pins.
 *
 * With the grid minimum released, everything inside already behaves: `.rules-item .body` has
 * `min-width: 0` and ellipsizes, the toolbar wraps, and the buttons stay on-canvas.
 * Re-measured with the rule applied: document scrollWidth 390 at 390, rows/pills/nav all
 * inside the viewport, both themes.
 *
 * MUTATION WATCH: deleting the `.set-layout > *` block from app.css turns the first
 * assertion red; restoring `white-space: nowrap` on `.rules-confirm .what` turns the
 * second red.

/**
 * SET-H1/M5 — A FIELD'S VERB DROPS TO ITS OWN LINE RATHER THAN CRUSHING THE FIELD.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT, MEASURED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `.set-field-row` is a field with its verb beside it — the AI key and its "Save key and test".
 * It was `display:flex` with `flex:1 1 auto` on the field and `flex:none` on the button, which
 * gives the field no floor at all: at the narrow width the row is 290px and the German label
 * ("Gespeicherten Schlüssel testen") is 255px of it, so the key input rendered about 40px wide
 * — a password field too narrow to show that anything had been pasted into it. Measured in
 * Chromium at 390/760/1440 × en/de against the real pane.
 *
 * The fix is a FLEX BASIS, not a media query: 200px is the floor at which the field would
 * rather wrap the button than shrink further. Re-measured with it applied — 390: field 290px
 * with the button on its own line, both languages; 760 and 1440: both on one line, field
 * 259-479px. No width is special-cased, so a third language is handled by the same rule.
 *
 * MUTATION WATCH: restore `flex: 1 1 auto` (or drop `flex-wrap`) and this goes red.
