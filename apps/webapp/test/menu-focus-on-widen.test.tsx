/**
 * ═══ WIDENING THE COLUMN TOOK THE KEYBOARD OUT OF THE OPEN MENU ════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── THE SEQUENCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The action bar folds whole groups of verbs behind More as its container narrows, and hands them
 * back to the row as it widens. "In the row or in the menu, never both" is one rule pair per group
 * in `action-bar.css`, keyed off the measurement's `data-admit`, so a widen switches a group's
 * MENU half off — and it can happen while the menu is open, with the keyboard on the very item
 * that leaves.
 *
 * Nothing repaired that. The item became `display: none` with focus on it; the browser blurs a
 * hidden element, so focus landed on `<body>`; and from there the menu's own key handler — which
 * is on the menu — never ran again. Arrow keys did nothing, and the next letter typed went
 * straight to the shell's mail shortcuts and acted on the message underneath the menu still on
 * screen.
 *
 * ── WHY AN INLINE `display` IS THE HONEST STAND-IN ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no layout engine and no stylesheet here, so a container query cannot be driven. What
 * the production rules DO is set `display: none` on the item, and `live()` asks
 * `getComputedStyle(el).display` — deliberately, so the question is answerable in both places
 * (see its own comment). Setting the property inline produces the same computed answer from the
 * same read. What this cannot reproduce is the browser's blur, so the blur is performed
 * explicitly in the case that is about it, and the case beside it covers the other order.
 *
 * ── WHY `MoreMenu` DIRECTLY AND NOT THE BAR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The repair is the menu's, and the menu is shared: the message panel's ⋯ menu and the contact
 * popover mount the same component. Driving it through the bar would prove it for one of the
 * three callers and would need the whole admission machinery to change an item's `display`, which
 * jsdom cannot do at all. The harness wires the trigger and the menu exactly as `ActionBar` does
 * — the same shape `more-disclosure-dismiss.test.ts` uses, for the same reason.
 *
 * ── HOW TO WATCH IT FAIL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Counts, because a wrong one sends the next person hunting. Pin the focus effect back to
 * mount-only (delete the repair effect, the one with no dependency array) and FOUR cases go red:
 * the three repair cases and the emptied-menu one, which reports "the emptied menu did not ask to
 * be dismissed: expected +0 to be 1". The fifth, "focus moved somewhere else ON PURPOSE", stays
 * green under that mutation and is meant to. Remove the single-character arm of `onKeyDown` and
 * exactly one case goes red — the letter one, at "a did not claim the event away from the document
 * listener" — while the positive control beside it (Enter, Tab, Space, a modified combo) stays
 * green.
