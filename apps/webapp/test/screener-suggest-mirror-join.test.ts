/**
 * THE TWO SOURCES OF ONE CHIP, JOINED IN ONE PLACE. The mirror fills a derived row's `ai` from
 * the `/sync` entity; the session overlay holds what THIS session bought or re-read. The overlay
 * is the fresher layer and WINS on a derived row — a "Suggest again" answers into it the moment
 * the response lands, and the mirror's previous row must not mask that answer until the next
 * delta. A fixture row keeps the demo's own `ai`. MUTATION-WATCH: restore the old guard —
 * `if (!overlay || x.ai || x.derived !== true) return x;` — and "the overlay's fresher answer
 * wins" goes red with the stale mirror verdict rendered after a re-buy. That mutation was run.
