/**
 * ═══ OPENING COMPOSE MEANS WRITING — the caret, and the keys that must go quiet ══════════
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS WRONG ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured on the deployed desktop: press `c`, start typing, and nothing you type appears —
 * the form opened with NO field focused. Worse, with focus nowhere the typing guard
 * (`isTypingTarget`) sees no field, so every letter was still a live mailbox shortcut acting
 * on the message selected BEHIND the form: `e` parked it, `b` resurfaced it, the digits
 * navigated the rail, `/` left for Search — letter by letter, while the placeholders stayed
 * empty. The composer looked open and idle; the mailbox behind it was being filed.
 *
 * ── THE TWO HALVES OF THE FIX, AND WHY BOTH ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. FOCUS ON MOUNT (`ComposeView.initialFocus`): the caret lands in the first field with
 *     nothing in it — To, then Subject, then the body. Decided once, at mount, so a
 *     re-render can never steal the caret back.
 *  2. THE WRITING-SURFACE CLAIM (`keymap.useWritingSurface`): focus is one blur away from
 *     nowhere (a click on dead space), so while the composer is MOUNTED the dispatcher
 *     refuses every chord a person could TYPE — bare letters, shifted ones, punctuation and
 *     the `g …` sequences — and the two they EDIT with, ⌫ and ⌦, which are named keys the
 *     typeable test passed while the mailbox bound both to "file this message to Trash".
 *     Escape, Tab, Enter and `mod` chords pass; a binding the composer itself owns opts back
 *     in (`inWriting`: the send-later digits, the `?` sheet).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the modal gate: the compose form was moved OUT of a dialog the keyboard
 * could not leave (`ComposeView`), and `modalIsOpen()` answering true for it would make
 * every other gate treat the composer as standing over the deck. The claim suspends exactly
 * the chords a writer could press and nothing else.
 *
 * Part one drives the DISPATCHER through fixture components (the `modal-suspends-keymap`
 * harness); part two drives the SHIPPED SHELL, because the wiring — ComposeView claiming the
 * surface, the mount focus finding the real inputs — is exactly what a unit fixture cannot
 * see.
