/**
 * KEYBOARD CHROME ON A DEVICE WITH NO KEYBOARD.
 *
 * ── WALKED AT PHONE WIDTH ON A LIVE ACCOUNT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three pieces of key chrome, on a phone:
 *
 *   1. a **⌘K pill in the mobile top bar** whose entire label is a chord;
 *   2. **"esc to return"** over the reading overlay;
 *   3. the **"Command ⌘K"** control — a real button wearing a keycap nobody can press. (It was
 *      a capsule floating over the page when this was walked; it is a row at the foot of the
 *      rail now, and the rule and this file followed it there.)
 *
 * The precedent is from the same day: the reader's action bar rests at `opacity:.35` and lifts
 * on hover, which on touch means it is PERMANENTLY dimmed because the hover never comes. That
 * was fixed under `@media (hover: none)` at `action-bar.css:242`. This is the same idea aimed
 * at the other half — an affordance describing an INPUT the device does not have — so it keys
 * on `(pointer: coarse)`.
 *
 * ── WHAT A GUARD CAN AND CANNOT SEE HERE, SAID PLAINLY ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **jsdom evaluates no CSS.** No test in this repository can watch a media query take effect,
 * and pretending otherwise with a `getComputedStyle` assertion would be a guard that passes
 * whatever the stylesheet says. A media query needs two independent things to be true, and
 * both of them ARE observable:
 *
 *   · the RULE exists, is inside `@media (pointer: coarse)`, and hides the element;
 *   · its SELECTOR really does match the element it names, in the DOM the app renders.
 *
 * The second half is the one that rots. `.topbar > .tb-btn:last-child` stops matching the
 * moment somebody appends a button to the top bar, and nothing about the stylesheet would look
 * wrong. So the selectors are read OUT OF the stylesheet and run against real mounted output —
 * the shipped `AppShell` for the top bar and the rail's dock rows, and the shipped `@ohmail/ui`
 * components for the other two. A selector that has stopped matching fails here rather than on
 * somebody's phone.
