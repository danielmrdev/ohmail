/**
 * THE TWO BULK RUNS, AS TRACKS — and the arithmetic that must never reach the screen.
 *
 * Buying suggestions and applying them are both several seconds of work dispatched a chunk (or a
 * row) at a time, and until now the only evidence either was happening was a sentence whose
 * numbers changed. Both paths publish their progress as TWO NUMBERS beside that sentence rather
 * than as a string to be parsed back out of it — see `SuggestBatchControl.progress` — and this is
 * the surface reading them.
 *
 * Three claims, and the third is the one worth writing a file for:
 *
 *  1. A RUNNING BULK DRAWS A TRACK, off the field, with the field's own two numbers.
 *  2. NO FIELD, NO TRACK. Both fields are null in every state but "in flight", so a finished run
 *     leaves nothing behind — a filled bar that never goes away is a claim that work is still
 *     happening.
 *  3. A DENOMINATOR OF ZERO DRAWS NOTHING. `value/max` with `max` of 0 is an indeterminate bar
 *     and `NaN%` in the accessibility tree: a run that claims to be in flight for ever, narrated
 *     as arithmetic that went wrong. There is no honest track without a total, so there is no
 *     track.
 *
 * MUTATION WATCH — each of these was applied to `ScreenerView.tsx`, watched go red, and reverted
 * (2026-08-09):
 *   · `BulkProgress`' `total > 0` guard relaxed to `total < 0` → both zero-denominator tests.
 *   · the suggest bar rendered unconditionally, defaulting a null `progress` to `0 of 40` →
 *     the not-in-flight test.
