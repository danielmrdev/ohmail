/**
 * ── THE CONSEQUENCE IS ON SCREEN WHERE IT IS INCURRED (mail 0054) ────────────────────────
 *
 * Screening a sender out, or pressing the Screener's spam verb, hands the mail that decision
 * re-routed to the one-click unsubscribe path. That has been true and INVISIBLE in the Screener
 * since the trigger was wired: the sender sheet asks before the click, but the Screener — the
 * surface where nearly every one of these decisions is actually made, one key per stranger —
 * said only "Screened out — …" and "Marked spam — …".
 *
 * This file renders the REAL hook and reads the toast options exactly as `ToastHost` receives
 * them, for `sender-sheet-reachable.test.tsx`'s reason: a sentence that exists only in a
 * catalogue and never reaches a surface is the repository's recurring "built, tested,
 * unreachable" shape, and a copy-only assertion cannot tell the two apart.
 *
 * ── WHY A TOAST HERE AND A CONFIRM THERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not an inconsistency. The sheet's click can widen to a whole domain at once, so its disclosure
 * has to be a gate; the Screener is the triage loop, and a confirm in front of every `n` and `x`
 * would make the queue unusable. What the Screener owes is that the thing happening is visible
 * while it can still be undone — and the toast carries the undo.
 *
 * ── THE THREE CLAIMS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. The two DEMOTING decisions say it. Delete the `unsub` argument at either call site and the
 *     ICU `select` falls to `other {}`, which is silence — so these go red on the exact mutation
 *     that would ship the feature undisclosed again.
 *  2. The three KEEP destinations never say it, and that is a claim about truth rather than
 *     tidiness: `ohmail/News` and `ohmail/Receipts` were deliberately REMOVED from the
 *     unsubscribe service's actionable set, so a sentence there would be false.
 *  3. The account switch silences it. Wire `autoUnsubscribe` to a constant `true` and this goes
 *     red, which is the "states the consequence only when the mechanism will run" half.
 */

/* The held bodies here are never read, so each sentence is the CONDITIONAL one; the line before the
