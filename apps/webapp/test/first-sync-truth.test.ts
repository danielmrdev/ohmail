/**
 * THE FIRST-SYNC STRIP SAID TWO THINGS, AND NEITHER WAS TRUE.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS WALKED ON THE HOSTED SERVICE, 2026-08-04 ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Cloud trial with a real IMAP mailbox. The strip said:
 *
 *     Waiting for the first mail to arrive. A first sync takes a few minutes.
 *
 * The first sync took **~25 minutes**. And past the ten-minute escalation it said:
 *
 *     Still nothing has arrived.
 *
 * while FIVE messages were sitting in INBOX and the worker had already moved one of them on
 * the server. So the sentence was not merely stale; it made a claim about the MAILBOX, which
 * is the one thing this client cannot see. `deriveMailState`'s `awaiting` arm fires on
 * `lastSyncAt === null` for every connected mailbox and an empty mirror — "no sync cycle has
 * finished", which is a fact about US. Everything the copy is allowed to say has to fit inside
 * that.
 *
 * ── THE DURATION, AND WHY THERE IS NOW NO NUMBER AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "A few minutes" was not invented; it was measured. `mail-state.ts`'s own note records
 * `mailbox_attach_started → mailbox_attached` at a few minutes for an ordinary mailbox,
 * twice, in production. Two samples at ~6 minutes and one walked observation at ~25 is not a
 * distribution, and a p90 is what a duration promise needs. Two points and an outlier support
 * no number, so the copy names none — the strip already renders the ELAPSED time beside the
 * sentence, which is the honest form of the same information and cannot go stale.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE AND NOT `sync-progress.test.ts` ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * That file owns the LADDER — which state fires when, and that a healthy six-minute wait is not
 * escalated. Its assertions were updated to the new strings because they quote them. This file
 * owns something the ladder cannot express: that whatever these two sentences are rewritten to
 * next, they may not promise a duration and may not speak about arrival. It is asserted as a
 * SHAPE, so a future rewording that reintroduces either claim in different words still fails.
