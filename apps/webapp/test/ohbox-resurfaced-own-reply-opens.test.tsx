/**
 * A RESURFACED CONVERSATION ROW ALWAYS OPENS — the reported shape, through the shipped shell.
 *
 * Desktop and web, 2026-09-21: under Resurfaced stood a conversation whose newest member was the
 * account's OWN outbound mail — the away responder's answer to a parked message, in Sent. The row
 * was keyed on that member: its face read "Me → …: I'm out of the office", and a click handed the
 * Sent copy's id to the reading column, which resolved it from the three Ohbox groups. A resurfaced
 * conversation's unpinned members are held out of all three, so the column kept "Nothing open."
 * The same id under `/search/m/<id>` rendered the conversation, which is how the miss was placed.
 */

/*
 * Measured here on a `/sync` page carrying exactly that: the inbound original (pinned), the
 * account's auto-reply to it (Sent, newer, same thread), the thread row and the sender's consent.
 * The click must open the conversation with the ORIGINAL in view — a person resurfaces a
 * conversation to see what came back, never their own out-of-office — and the reported web route,
 * which names the Sent copy, must open the conversation too rather than an empty pane.
