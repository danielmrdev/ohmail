/**
 * ONE ROW PER CONVERSATION UNDER RESURFACED, AS THE DOM — the rendered half of FEAT-020.
 *
 * The pin is per message, so a conversation parked as three messages stood as three rows, and the
 * reply that arrived while it was away stood a fourth time under "New for you". `resurfacedThreads`
 * answers which conversations are back; this measures what the list does with that answer: one row,
 * its lead in `data-id` and every member in `data-ids`, the conversation's own length, and the
 * badge for what arrived since the pin went up — a chip, distinct from the unread dot, because the
 * dot says "not read" and this says "somebody wrote while this was waiting".
