/**
 * (the code half) — TWO SMALL THINGS THE WALK FOUND, WHICH ARE THE SAME THING TWICE.
 *
 * ── 1. THE SIGNUP ACCOUNT STEP SAID ONE SENTENCE TWICE, FOUR LINES APART ────────────────
 *
 * `JoinScreen`'s account step renders `step_account_lead`, then a label, then an input, then
 * `emailHintOpen`. On the open path those were:
 *
 *     This is your ohmail sign-in. It is not a new email address — your mail stays where it is.
 *     …
 *     Where we will reach you about your account. It is not a new email address.
 *
 * Saying it twice in the same eyeful does not reassure; it makes the reader wonder which one
 * they misread. The lead keeps it, because the lead is where the misconception lives and it is
 * the version that also says what DOES happen to their mail.
 *
 * ── 2. AN EMPTY OHBOX WAS TWO HEADINGS AND NOTHING ELSE ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The pane rendered "New" and "Earlier" unconditionally, and its empty-state component
 * (`SyncState`) returned `null` unless `screenerCandidate` — which requires mail to have landed
 * and the mirror to have settled, and is therefore FALSE for the whole of a first sync. On a
 * live account that is a first sync's many minutes, and what was on screen for it was the two words
 * "New" and "Earlier" over a blank column. A heading asserts that a section follows; two
 * headings over nothing read as a screen that failed to load.
 *
 * ── WHY THE TWO ARE IN ONE FILE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They are one finding in the audit and one defect in kind: the product stating something that
 * is not so — once by repetition, once by a label with nothing under it. The guards are
 * separate and fail independently.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * the other two items are owner decisions, not code: the Stripe checkout's public business
 * name, and whether the beta is invite-only (login says it is; `/join` accepted a signup with
 * no code). **Nothing in this file asserts either way about invite-only**, because writing a
 * test for it would be picking a side nobody has picked yet, and the copy would then have
 * a guard holding it in place.
