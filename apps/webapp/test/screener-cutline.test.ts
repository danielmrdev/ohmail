/**
 * THE SCREENER IS THE CONSENT CUTLINE'S OWN SURFACE, AND IT WAS THE ONE THAT IGNORED IT.
 *
 * `consentPartition` decides where every message is PRESENTED, and `presentationReader` hands the
 * pile selectors a mirror in which grouping by folder IS grouping by place. Ohbox, Reads,
 * Receipts, the triage piles, Tags and History were all built from that projected reader. The
 * Screener queue was built from `engine.read()` — the raw mirror — so it grouped by the folder
 * the mail server happens to hold the message in and the cutline never reached it.
 *
 * ── WHY THAT IS WORSE THAN A COSMETIC MISCOUNT ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured on a large real mailbox whose backfill had already filed most of its messages into
 * `ohmail/Screener`: the queue offered **far more sender rows than anyone could screen**, most of them senders who
 * went quiet years ago and whose mail was simultaneously being presented in History. The cutline
 * put the real queue at **a small fraction of that**. Three distinct wrongs, one cause:
 *
 *   1. a DORMANT undecided sender is a Screener row AND a History row at once — the double
 *      presentation the cutline exists to prevent;
 *   2. a CONSENTED sender's backlog still sitting in the Screener folder is a Screener row even
 *      though it presents in the Ohbox, so the product asks for a decision it already has;
 *   3. the rail badge and the header count are that same raw number, so the one number telling
 *      somebody how much screening they owe was off by most of itself.
 *
 * ── THE ONE THE OBVIOUS FIX INTRODUCED, AND HOW #116 CLOSED IT ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Projecting the reader also pulls an active undecided sender's INBOX mail into the waiting
 * bucket, because the partition presents it in the Screener. The grouping is right to include it;
 * the ROW ID may not name it for a decide. `POST /screener/:id` resolves only messages whose
 * `desired_folder` is `ohmail/Screener`, and `derivedScreenerEffects` refuses locally on the same
 * condition — so a DECIDE on an INBOX representative renders every control and performs none of
 * them. The first cut suppressed such rows entirely, which was the #116 vanish: a bulk-moved
 * undecided+active sender (its mail all in the INBOX, presented at the gate) had no row anywhere
 * but search, and re-screening it silently did nothing.
 *
 * So the row IS minted — on the newest GATE-PHYSICAL message when the sender has one (the mixed
 * case below pins that id), else on `newestFirst[0]`, marked `gatePhysical:false`. That flag routes
 * the commit PAST THE GATE as a `rule_create` (destination INBOX for a screen-in) with `applyRetro`
 * rather than a dead decide, so the control performs and the sender's bag lands in the Ohbox.
 *
 * ── WHY THE FIXTURE PUTS MAIL IN `ohmail/Screener` AND NOT THE INBOX ──────────────────────
 *
 * `history-view.test.ts` seeds everything in the INBOX, which is why it never caught this: with
 * no message physically in the Screener folder, `screenerSegments` over the raw mirror yields an
 * empty queue and agrees with the projected one by accident. The defect is only visible on a
 * mailbox whose mail has ALREADY been filed into the Screener — which is every mailbox that has
 * been through a backfill, i.e. the normal case rather than an edge one.
 *
 * One message per sender except where the point IS two, and every date distinct: a row's id is its
 * sender's newest gate-physical message, and a tie would make these assertions depend on
 * `byDateDesc`'s id tiebreak rather than on the rule under test.
