/**
 * CC/BCC WAIT BEHIND THE TOGGLE — one rule, every composer instance.
 *
 * Editing To is the main act, so the Cc and Bcc rows collapse behind the "Kopie/Blindkopie"
 * affordance while BOTH are empty, and open THEMSELVES the moment either carries text — a
 * reply-all whose Cc holds real people must never hide recipients the user cannot see they
 * have. The rule lived twice (Compose's `ccBccOpen` expression and `ReplyRecipients`' `open`),
 * which is two copies one edit apart from folding differently; it is ONE exported derivation
 * now (`RecipientField.ccBccOpen`) and the source guard below is what keeps every instance —
 * fresh compose, the mailto-seeded compose, reply, reply-all, the inline forward — reading it
 * rather than growing a flag of its own.
 *
 * The behavioral halves are pinned where the surfaces live: the plain reply's collapsed rows
 * and the toggle's reveal in `reply-recipients.test.tsx`, the compose form's in
 * `compose-composition.test.ts`, the inline forward's in `thread-inline-forward.test.tsx`.
