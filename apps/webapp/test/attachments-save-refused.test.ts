/**
 * A DOWNLOAD THE SHELL WOULD NOT SAVE IS SAID AT THE PRESS. On a Linux profile whose
 * user-dirs name no Downloads folder the desktop shell refuses the save, and the press saved
 * nothing and said nothing: the refusal reached the console only. Through the real hook, a real
 * engine and the shell's own rejection, the press now answers with the refusal, and never with the
 * shell's words. Mutations watched red: `open`'s refusal arm dropped; `downloadAll` dropping
 * `onRefused`; `saveRefusalOf` answering `not-saved` for every refusal.
