/**
 * THE ONE SUBSCRIPTION ROW — present only where there is somewhere to send the customer, and the
 * address minted only when somebody asks to go there.
 *
 * The open app holds no plan, no price and no credit balance. It asks whether this deployment
 * operates a subscription page for this account (`GET /account/access`, which mints nothing) and
 * renders one control, or renders nothing: a row whose control goes nowhere is the one control a
 * person on a settings pane will press.
 *
 * The MINT used to ride the mount, and the pane was offered only once a link had come back — so
 * every shell mount and every settings visit minted an address nobody had asked for. The zero
 * below is that defect's guard.
 *
 * The harness is the shell's own expression (`manageOffered ? <SubscriptionSection
 * onNowhere={withdrawManage} /> : undefined`), which `settings-section-parity.test.tsx` pins
 * against `CloudShell.tsx` as text — together they say what a mounted shell does without mounting
 * one.
 *
 * `apps/webapp` typechecks its tests, so the props below are checked as well as the values.
