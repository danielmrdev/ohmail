/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  SIGNING BACK IN MUST PUT BACK WHAT SIGNING OUT TOOK AWAY
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The mirror image of `sign-out-revokes-wake.test.ts`, and it exists because closing the defect
 * that file guards opened this one.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Sign-out deletes this browser's `push_subscriptions` row, drops the local subscription, and
 * writes the service worker's notify-state `enabled: false`. Two things deliberately SURVIVE it:
 * `ohmail.notifications.channels` — a per-install preference, like the theme, and sweeping it
 * would be honest about the wire and wrong about the person — and the OS permission, which is
 * the browser's to hold and not ours.
 *
 * So the same reader signing back in on their own laptop had `subscriptionWanted()` true, every
 * switch in the pane rendering ON, and behind them no server row and a worker under orders not
 * to draw. Closed-browser new-mail notices were silently off, with nothing on screen to say so.
 * Nothing re-established either half: the app's ONLY reconcile was `SettingsView`'s mount
 * effect, so the switches told the truth again if and only if the reader went looking in
 * Settings.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS COVERED WHERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The `syncWebPush` ON path itself is covered in `web-push-subscription.test.ts`. What is
 * covered HERE is the boot wrapper around it: that it restores BOTH halves from the stale state
 * a sign-out leaves, that it reconciles to what the switches actually say rather than to ON,
 * that a stalled queue cannot hold the shell's boot open, and that it cannot throw out of a boot
 * effect. That the SHELL calls it — once per sign-in, with Settings never mounted — is
 * `shell-boot-reconciles-wake.test.ts`.
