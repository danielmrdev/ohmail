/**
 * AN OPEN OVERLAY OWNS ESCAPE, EVEN WITH A SELECTION LIVE.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS WRONG ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Ohbox's "Escape clears the selection" is a VIEW binding and the shell's Escape cascade
 * was a GLOBAL one, so a picked set outranked the cascade unconditionally. Select two rows,
 * open the `?` sheet — or the ⌘K palette, or a sender's screening popover — press Escape,
 * and the selection was cleared while the thing you were looking at stayed put. It had been
 * patched once, for the reply editor alone, by teaching the Ohbox to check
 * `chrome.replyTo != null`: one shell overlay, named inside a view that cannot see the other
 * seven.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE MOUNTS THE WHOLE SHELL ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `keymap.test.ts` proves the scope ordering with synthetic bindings, and it should. It
 * cannot prove THIS, because the bug was never in the dispatcher — it was in which scope the
 * real Escape was registered under, with the real overlays and the real selection. So every
 * case below opens the actual surface out of the actual `AppShell` and presses the actual
 * key, and each one asserts BOTH halves: the overlay closed, and the selection is still
 * there. The second half is the one that goes red when the precedence is put back.
 *
 * Demo mode, because the selection and the overlays are pure shell state — Mila's fixture
 * world gives real rows to pick with no network, no account and no fake server to keep
 * honest.
