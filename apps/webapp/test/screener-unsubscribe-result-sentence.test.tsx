/**
 * THE SENTENCE A PERSON READS AFTER PRESSING UNSUBSCRIBE (a high review finding).
 *
 * The record for a list is written BEFORE the request, so its existence says only that somebody
 * got as far as trying. The service answered `already_recorded` on any conflict and this control
 * rendered "Already unsubscribed from this list." over it — so a person whose unsubscribe was
 * claimed and then stranded by a DNS failure was told the thing was done, while the mail kept
 * arriving. The acceptance is the sentence, not the service's return code.
 *
 * Read from the RENDERED output. Watched red by putting the old mapping back (every refusal that
 * is not null rendering `unsubAlready`): the first case then reads the completed sentence for a
 * send that never happened.
