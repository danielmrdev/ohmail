/**
 * A WITHDRAWN SEND IS NOT A PENDING ONE. Cancel keeps the queued send's durable row, marked, until
 * the next boot drops it; the raw outbox reader counted the row without reading the mark, so a
 * cancelled send still read as "on its way" to the compose hold and the reply-lane promotion. Both
 * branches of the reader — the stamped cache and the plain read — are driven by a real withdrawal.
 * Mutation: the reader's `withdrawn` filter removed → cases 1 and 2 red.
