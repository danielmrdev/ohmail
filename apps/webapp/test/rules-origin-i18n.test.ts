/**
 * SETTINGS-RULES-I18N — every rule provenance must have a sentence in `rules.origin`.
 *
 * `RulesView` renders a rule's origin with `t(`origin.${rule.provenance}`)`
 * (`app/views/RulesView.tsx:153`). A provenance value with no key renders the raw key path —
 * "rules.origin.seeded-from-sent" — straight into the rule's meta line. That is visible to any
 * user whose Ohbox was seeded from their Sent mail, which is the DEFAULT onboarding path, so the
 * gap was on the most-travelled surface rather than an edge one.
 *
 * The provenance union is `manual | migrated | promoted | seeded-from-sent`
 * (`packages/client-engine/src/types.ts`, `packages/core/src/rules.ts`). It is restated as a
 * literal here on purpose: importing the type gives no runtime set to check, and this guard's job
 * is precisely to go red when a value is added there and its sentence is not added here.
