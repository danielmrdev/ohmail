/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  ONE VERB, ONE ADMISSION — "Use folders" is a term in NONE of the delete predicates
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Delete is a MOVE to the mail server's own \Trash — a system folder every account already has,
 * discovered at connect beside \Junk — never to a folder somebody made. So the USER-folders
 * foundation flag was never a fact about whether the verb can run, and the engine's
 * `message_delete` has never read it. The verb over a SELECTION never read it either.
 *
 * The cursor verb read it in FOUR places, and that is why this file counts rather than reads:
 * the four are one edit, and a fix that lands in three of them is a coherent program that
 * compiles, passes every behavioural test that happens to drive the other three, and leaves the
 * `?` sheet advertising a delete one door refuses — which is the exact asymmetry the four-site
 * fix removed. Measured live on a folders-off account before the fix: a picked row deleted with
 * a "Moved to Trash." toast and a `DELETE /messages/:id` on the wire, while the row under the
 * cursor produced nothing at all — no toast, no refusal sentence, no request — and the `?` sheet
 * drew both `d` and `⌫·⌦` greyed.
 *
 * ── WHY A SOURCE CENSUS AND NOT FOUR MORE BEHAVIOURAL CASES ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There ARE behavioural cases, and they are the primary evidence: `delete-key-shell.test.tsx`
 * presses ⌫ on a folders-off shell, `action-bar.test.ts` opens the strip with no flag on the
 * chrome, `split-view-keys.test.tsx` presses `d` in a split view with the consent answering off.
 * What none of them can see is a FIFTH site appearing later — a new door, or a re-added term
 * behind a branch no fixture takes. This file is the one that fails then.
 *
 * ── HOW TO WATCH IT FAIL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Re-add `consent.foldersEnabled === true &&` to any one of the three AppShell predicates, or
 * `chrome.foldersEnabled === true &&` to `deleteConfirmAdmitted`, and exactly that site's case
 * goes red naming itself. Rename a predicate and the anchor case goes red instead of the count
 * silently passing over a region it no longer found — which is the failure a census must not
 * have.

/**
 * TWO OF THE FOUR SITES ARE DECLARATIONS AND USE THE REPO'S HELPER; TWO CANNOT.
 *
 * `canDeleteMessage` and `deleteConfirmAdmitted` are `const <name> =` declarations, so they are
 * anchored with `sliceOfDeclaration`, which throws `anchor not found: <name>` rather than handing
 * back an empty slice every assertion passes over — and `anchor-census.test.ts` refuses the older
 * shape (`indexOf("const X = useStableCallback")`) across this whole directory, because a codemod
 * that re-spells the hook silently empties the window. The first version of this file anchored
 * site 1 that way and that census caught it.
 *
 * The other two are not declarations at all: they are PROPERTIES inside the shell's key-binding
 * array (`disabled:` on the `d` entry, `canDelete:` in the `deleteKeyBindings` spread), which the
 * helper has no name to find. They keep the literal-anchor form below, with the two guards that
 * make the same failure loud: the terminator must be FOUND after the anchor, and the region must
 * be implausibly short of a whole file. A missing anchor is a named failure in both shapes; what
 * is never allowed is a window that quietly becomes empty.
