/**
 * ═══ "MOVE → OHBOX" ON A MESSAGE IN READS DID NOTHING, TWICE ══════════════════════════════
 *
 * Reported against the shipped 0.19.0 desktop, with a screenshot: a newsletter in
 * Reads, Move → Ohbox, no action — pressed twice.
 *
 * Reads is not a folder that mail sits in. `consentPartition` PRESENTS a message at the place the
 * sender's rule names, so that newsletter was physically in the INBOX the whole time and the pile
 * was a projection over it. Both the strip that offers the destinations and the arm that acted on
 * one compared against that PRESENTED place, so "Ohbox" was offered and accepted; the folder move
 * they dispatched was INBOX→INBOX, which yields no effects, and the engine rejects an effectless
 * verb before the wire. The shell threw that answer away (`void`) and said "Moved to Ohbox."
 *
 * The fix is not a better sentence over the same nothing: the place is decided by the sender's
 * routing, so the press WRITES the routing — and on a mailbox organized in place the row then
 * moves with no folder touched at all.
 *
 * The shell mounted here is the shipped one and the engine is the real `OhmailEngine` over a real
 * mirror, in the standalone configuration the desktop bundles (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` cleared, the
 * engine handed in — `desktop-cutline.test.ts` sets out why that IS the desktop here). The adapter
 * ECHOES what it is sent, the way a server confirms a write: without the echo the engine settles
 * every verb against an empty answer and rolls its overlay off, and this file would measure the
 * rollback rather than the press.
