/**
 * ═══ THE ANCHOR-HOLD LOOP RUNS WHILE SOMETHING CAN MOVE, AND NOT OTHERWISE ═══════════════════
 *
 * The loop re-armed its own `requestAnimationFrame` unconditionally, so a mounted stream was a
 * 60 Hz forced layout for the life of the view. Measured on the shipped shell through CDP, signed
 * in, untouched for 120 s: a callback every frame and four `getBoundingClientRect` calls a frame
 * against ZERO DOM mutations — the loop was reading layout four times a frame to discover,
 * every frame, that nothing had happened.
 *
 * The rule now: armed by the things that can move the content it holds, stopped
 * {@link HOLD_QUIET_MS} after the last of them and while the document is hidden. Both halves are
 * here — a loop that never stops and a loop that never restarts are the same file passing.
 *
 * jsdom has no layout, so geometry is stubbed through the same reads a browser answers, and
 * `requestAnimationFrame` is a queue this file drains by hand: the number of callbacks OUTSTANDING
 * after a drain is the fact under test, and it cannot be reached by waiting.
