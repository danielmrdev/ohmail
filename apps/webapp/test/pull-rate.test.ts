/**
 * THE FIRST PULL'S RATE AND ETA — every rule that keeps this screen from inventing a number.
 *
 * The whole reason `pull-rate.ts` exists as a pure module is that its rules are REFUSALS, and a
 * refusal is invisible in a rendered screen: "working out how long this takes" looks identical
 * whether the gate is working or the arithmetic silently produced nothing. Each `null` below is
 * therefore asserted on its own, with the state that must produce it.
 *
 * The mutation contract, for the guards that are load-bearing:
 *
 *  · drop the `span < RATE_MIN_SPAN_MS` gate  → "a burst measured over 20 s is not the rate"
 *  · drop the `delta <= 0` gate               → "a mirror that stopped growing claims no rate"
 *  · make `pullRemaining` clamp at `>= 0`     → "a server total below the mirror says nothing"
 *  · drop the same-instant collapse           → "two reads in one millisecond are one sample"
