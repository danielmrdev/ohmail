/**
 * THE RECEIPTS "APPLICATION ERROR" — the windowed list must not measure its own leading row and
 * feed that measurement back into the arithmetic that CHOOSES the leading row.
 *
 * `useListWindow` measures the first rendered `.row` to keep its spacers honest. The first row of
 * a SCROLLED window is `all[start]`, and `start = floor(scrollTop / rowHeight)` — so if the leading
 * row's height differs from its neighbour's by even a pixel, setting `rowHeight` from it re-derives
 * `start`, which selects a DIFFERENT leading row, whose height re-sets `rowHeight`… React counts
 * the never-settling `setState` as a runaway and throws "Maximum update depth exceeded", which Next
 * paints as the whole-tab client-side "Application error" reported on opening Receipts.
 *
 * jsdom has no layout, so `offsetHeight` is 0 and the measurement never ran in any existing test —
 * which is exactly why this defect shipped. Here the rows are given a real, 1px-alternating height
 * (an amount pushes a receipt row a hair taller than its neighbour), the list is scrolled to a
 * boundary where the two candidate leading rows have the two heights, and the assertion is simply
 * that React does not loop. Freeze the measurement (`start === 0 || measured === 0`) and it is
 * green; take that guard away and both the throw and React's console runaway come back.
