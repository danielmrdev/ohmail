/**
 * CHOOSING THE PROVIDER YOU HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN MUST NOT DELETE WHAT YOU TYPED.
 *
 * Found while reproducing the connect flow behind the first external bug report. The report's
 * own cause was elsewhere (the desktop door sent a password with no transport — see
 * `apps/desktop/test/desktop-doors.test.ts`), but the flow it describes runs straight through
 * this control, and this control had a second way to produce the same sentence.
 *
 * The picker is a radiogroup. Its CHECKED tile is the group's roving tab stop, so tabbing in and
 * pressing Space or Enter re-fires the choice; clicking the tile you already chose does the same.
 * Every consumer answered a choice by writing the preset's hosts into its form — and the generic
 * "any other IMAP mailbox" preset's hosts are `""`. So a no-op re-selection wrote two empty
 * strings over the IMAP and SMTP hosts the person had typed, in fields below the fold, with no
 * visible change anywhere near the pointer.
 *
 * The banner for a failed submit renders directly ABOVE the provider grid, which makes the
 * re-click the single most likely next gesture: read the error, glance up, confirm the provider.
 * That gesture erased the field the error was complaining about.
 *
 * Two independent guards, because the two halves fail differently:
 *   · the control does not report a choice that did not change;
 *   · and the host rule itself refuses to overwrite with nothing, so a consumer that DOES get a
 *     legitimate re-notification (or reorders its state writes) still cannot lose the value.
 *
 * MUTATION WATCH (each applied, watched go red, restored):
 *   · `hostsFor` → `imapHost: p.imap.host` (the original unconditional write).
 *   · `ProviderPicker`'s `onClick` → `onChange(p.id)` unguarded.
