/**
 * AN ENTRY BEING TYPED IS UNFINISHED, NOT WRONG.
 *
 * Reported from the live build: typing "no" into To put a red "Not an address" bar under the
 * field WHILE the suggestion popover for that same prefix was open above it. `composePlan`
 * re-parses the whole field on every keystroke, so the first letter of every name was an
 * error until the last one arrived.
 *
 * ── THE PART THAT MATTERS IS WHAT WAS *NOT* CHANGED ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The gate is on the SENTENCE only. `canSend` reads `plan.mutation.to`, which `composePlan`
 * empties whenever any entry is unparseable — so a genuinely bad address still cannot be
 * sent, whether or not the line is on screen. These assertions exist to keep those two facts
 * separate, because the tempting version of this fix is to relax the parse.
