/**
 * SEARCH IS MILLISECONDS, AND THE CLIENT'S SHARE IS A FAILING TEST (owner, 2026-09-23): the
 * first page ≤ 250 ms end-to-end to the rendered list, the store's page ≤ 100 ms of it — so from
 * the moment the client asks for the page to the moment its first rows are in the DOM, the client
 * (wire read, engine, React, DOM) may spend 150 ms at p95. Driven through the real HttpAdapter
 * over a stub fetch answering the store's JSON; the server's 100 ms is the store twins' budget.
 * On a shared CPU the wall clock is the host's (p95 159-167 ms at load 38-54), so the MECHANISM is
 * asserted per run (the page asked first and once, its rows in one commit) and the TIME is the
 * client's own: wall minus this thread's run-queue wait, with the load named beside it.
