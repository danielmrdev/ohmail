/**
 * THE UNDO THAT OUTLIVED THE THING IT UNDID.
 *
 * ── WALKED ON A LIVE ACCOUNT, 2026-08-04 ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * *"Ohbox — filed … Undo"* was still there many minutes later, across every view, until another
 * toast replaced it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS REPRODUCIBLE, AND IT IS NOT QUITE WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE ───────────────────────
 *
 * `ToastHost` (`packages/ui/src/primitives/Toast.tsx`) does run its timer and does drop the
 * `on` class on schedule, so `.toast{opacity:0;pointer-events:none}` takes the capsule off
 * screen. What it did not do then was clear the toast STATE. Measured in this environment: 20 minutes
 * after the toast, the node still read `"Ohbox — filed.Undo"`, its `<button>` was still mounted,
 * still `tabIndex 0`, still not `disabled`, and activating it still called `onAction`.
 * `pointer-events:none` stops a mouse. It does not stop Tab + Enter and it does not remove the
 * control from a `role="status"` region a screen reader is browsing.
 *
 * So the durable harm is not the pixels. It is that the button stays LIVE for an action that
 * stopped being reversible seconds after it was offered — and that pressing it then said
 * **"Undone — 0 waiting again."**, the product claiming an act it did not perform, on the one
 * screen a person presses precisely in order to find out.
 *
 * ── WHY THE FIX IS TWO THINGS AND NOT A NUMBER ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The acceptance asks for an 8–10 s dismissal AND asks what Undo does after that long, and
 * those are the same question. Lengthening the toast alone would have WIDENED the defect: the
 * shipped pair was 6000 ms (toast) against 6200 ms (commit), so an 8 s toast over a 6.2 s
 * commit leaves ~2 s of a live control for a decision already on the wire. So the window is one
 * declared number with the commit derived from it, and `undo()` refuses to claim an undo it did
 * not perform — which is the half that still holds when the button outlives its own capsule.
 *
 * The stale node is gone since the host takes an Undo capsule's button out of the tree after its
 * fade (`packages/ui/test/toast-two-slots.test.tsx`); the guard below still answers a press made
 * through a callback held anywhere else.
