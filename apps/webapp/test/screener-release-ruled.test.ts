/**
 * RELEASING A SENDER A RULE IS HOLDING — the rule is the thing that has to change.
 *
 * ## THE LIVE SHAPE THIS CARRIES
 *
 * Measured on a production account, 2026-08-19. A sender carried an enabled
 * `sender` rule with `destination: "ohmail/Quarantine"`. The consent cutline presents a decided
 * sender's undecided-residence mail AT THE RULE'S DESTINATION (`consent-cutline.ts` — `decided
 * !== null ⇒ placeOf = decided`), so their INBOX and Screener mail all presented in Spam beside
 * the mail physically quarantined — the row said "25 held". Every press of "Not spam → Ohbox"
 * answered *"sender@example.test is still in Spam — that change could not be saved. Try it again."*,
 * for two defects that compound:
 *
 *  1. the release issued a bare `move` for EVERY held id. For mail already physically at the
 *     destination (`INBOX`), `mutationEffects` answers no effects (`msg.folder === m.folder`),
 *     `Engine.mutate` rolls back locally with a 404 AND NOTHING SENT — so `moveAll` reported the
 *     release refused, forever, deterministically;
 *  2. even the moves that landed changed nothing on screen: the RULE was never touched, and the
 *     projection re-presented the moved mail straight back into Spam. Retrying could not help —
 *     and adding an allow rule instead would not either, because `core/src/rules.ts#compareRules`
 *     ranks deny over allow at equal priority, so the standing deny rule keeps winning ingest.
 *
 * `screener-reversal-holds.test.ts` measured half of this while it was being written — its header
 * documents that a fixture rule pointing at Quarantine "makes the cutline present the sender's
 * INBOX mail back in Spam, so a release that SUCCEEDED left the row exactly where a refused one
 * does" — and then deliberately emitted no rules so its own subject (watched moves) stayed
 * observable. This file is the other half: worlds WITH such a rule, asserting the release
 * REWRITES it.
 *
 * ## WHAT A RELEASE MUST DO NOW
 *
 *  · "Not spam → Ohbox" / "Allow" RETARGETS every enabled, term-free rule filing this sender at
 *    the segment's folder (`rule_update` → the pressed destination) — one rule row flips both the
 *    presentation and future ingest, and the server's retro pass walks the backlog;
 *  · "Not spam → Screener" DELETES those rules — back to Waiting means undecided, and no rule may
 *    point at the gate;
 *  · moves are issued ONLY for mail physically in the segment's folder. Mail presented here by
 *    the rule alone needs no move once the rule is gone — and asking for one is the local 404 of
 *    defect 1;
 *  · the rule half is WATCHED like the moves: a refused retarget marks the row "Not saved" and
 *    raises the refusal sentence.
