/**
 * THE NUMBER ON SCREEN IS THE NUMBER THAT WILL BE ENFORCED.
 *
 * The compose surface stated "Up to 3 MB" as a hard-coded literal. That number came from the hosted
 * API's serverless request-body limit, and it was a claim the product could not keep in either
 * direction: a provider capping submission below it let a user pick a file, press Send, wait, and
 * have their own server bounce the message; and a local install — same code, same process, no
 * request body anywhere in the path — refused files its own mail server would have taken.
 *
 * So the control takes the cap as a PROP and renders the prop, and the prop is
 * `min(this surface's own ceiling, what this mailbox's server announced)`. These guards pin the
 * three joints: the `min`, the strict fallback, and the fact that the sentence is rendered from the
 * same value the picker refuses against.
