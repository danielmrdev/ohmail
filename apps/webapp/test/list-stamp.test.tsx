/**
 * THE DATE ON A LIST ROW SAYS WHICH SATURDAY, AND ONE PRESS ASKS THE WHOLE LIST.
 *
 * A row stamp is relative because that is what a list is scanned by — "Sat", "09:12", "3 Aug".
 * The one question it cannot answer is the obvious one: which Saturday, and at what time. So
 * hovering a date names the exact instant, and PRESSING one flips every date in the list to the
 * exact form at once — not row by row, because a reader comparing dates wants them in the same
 * shape, and not for this list only, because the message open beside it is showing the same mail.
 *
 * The three things asserted here, none of which `MessageRow` can own:
 *
 *   · WHICH TWO FORMS, and which of them is on screen (`rowStamp` in `shell/format.ts`). The title
 *     is always the form that is NOT displayed, so a hover says something new either way.
 *   · THAT THE PRESS REACHES THE WHOLE LIST — a real view, a real shell-held boolean, one press on
 *     ONE row's date, every other row flipped with it.
 *   · THAT THE PRESS IS NOT AN OPEN. The date sits inside the row button; a press on it must flip
 *     the list and leave the cursor exactly where it was.
 *
 * A message with NO `Date:` header has one form and no flip at all — see the last case. That is
 * the production path that keeps `MessageRow`'s unwired branch honest rather than theoretical.
