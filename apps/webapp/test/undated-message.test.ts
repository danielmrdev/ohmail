/**
 * "Ohbox ·", AND THE SEPARATOR THAT INTRODUCED NOTHING.
 *
 * ── WALKED ON A LIVE ACCOUNT, 2026-08-04 ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A message with **no `Date:` header** rendered a blank stamp and a dangling separator. Spam
 * and scripts omit `Date:` routinely; it is optional in practice and nothing in this pipeline
 * substitutes for it. `packages/core/src/mime.ts:459` writes `parsed.date ?? null`,
 * `dto/materialize.ts` passes the null through, and `messageDisplayTime` answers `""` —
 * correctly, because there is no instant to format. Three surfaces then interpolated that empty
 * string into templates that had already committed to the separator.
 *
 * A dangling "·" is not cosmetic. It is the interface asserting a second fact follows, when
 * there is none — the same untrue statement as this slice's five siblings, made in punctuation.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE FALLBACK BELONGS, AND WHERE IT DOES NOT ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The acceptance asks for IMAP INTERNALDATE and that is the right value — but it is not
 * reachable from any surface, and it is not reachable from the DTO either:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing persists it.** INTERNALDATE is read only for ORDERING, into an in-memory cache
 *     (`arrivalKey`, `packages/core/src/adapters/imap.ts:70`). `messages` has no column for it.
 *     The only always-present stamps `dto/materialize.ts` could coalesce to are `createdAt` /
 *     `updatedAt` — when OUR worker wrote the row — and `imap.ts:44-48` already records why
 *     that is the wrong answer: an imported mailbox "leaves every message stamped with the
 *     import time".
 *  2. **A non-null `MessageDTO.date` would desynchronise two orderings.** The server sorts by
 *     `messages.date`, still NULL; the client's `byDateDesc` reads a missing date as 0, i.e.
 *     oldest. A value synthesized on the wire would put an undated message NEWEST on the client
 *     and OLDEST on the server, and contract §5.2 makes the server's order the order.
 *
 * So the DTO is deliberately unchanged, the real repair is owed at ingest — where INTERNALDATE
 * is in hand and one write fixes every surface — and this file holds the display rule that
 * stops the product asserting a fact it does not have in the meantime. It stays correct after
 * the ingest fix lands: a date that is always present simply means no part is ever dropped.
