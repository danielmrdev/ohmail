/**
 * THE DATE FLIP IS AN APP-WIDE ROW LANGUAGE, NOT AN OHBOX FEATURE.
 *
 * `MessageRow` renders whichever form of the stamp it is handed and reports a press on it — so the
 * question this file answers is not "does the row work" (`packages/ui` owns that) and not "does
 * the press flip the list" (`list-stamp.test.tsx` owns that, against a real view). It is: does
 * EVERY mail list hand the row the two forms and the flip.
 *
 * That is a wiring fact spread over seven files with a silent failure mode. A list that forgets
 * the props looks completely normal — relative dates, exactly as before — it simply has one pile
 * whose dates cannot be read exactly while every other pile's can, and no render test that nobody
 * wrote will say so. This is the same census `row-participants-wiring.test.ts` keeps for the
 * thread circles, over the same six lists and for the same reason: adding a new mail list means
 * adding it here, which is the point.
 *
 * ScreenerView is deliberately absent, and it is the same exception it is there. Its rows are a
 * decision about a SENDER, not a message: the stamp on one is the newest held message's, a
 * detail of the queue rather than a date anybody is comparing.
