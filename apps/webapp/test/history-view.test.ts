/**
 * HISTORY — every message the account owns, newest first (ARCHIVE-024), and the claims that make
 * it honest:
 *
 *   1. it is REACHABLE, and the rail entry carries no count — ever;
 *   2. it lists everything the store holds, whatever pile the partition puts a message in;
 *   3. a message in it says where it actually is on the mail server;
 *   4. the partition still decides the PILES: a stranger's row on a consented thread stays out of
 *      the Ohbox and its conversation until the account answers — and reads whole from History.
 *
 * ── WHY THE FIXTURE LOOKS LIKE THIS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every message is in the INBOX physically, because that is the whole point: nothing moved.
 * What separates them is the sender and the clock. `old@` wrote once, long ago, and was read —
 * nobody ever decided about them, so their mail presents in History. `friend@` has a rule, so
 * their equally old mail presents in the Ohbox from the same INBOX. `loud@` is undecided but
 * UNREAD, so they are active and their mail is a Screener row rather than History.
 *
 * The dates are absolute rather than relative to `Date.now()`: the shell pins its clock to
 * `ISO`, and a fixture computing "400 days ago" from the real clock would drift past the
 * window on a machine whose date is wrong and fail for a reason that is not the subject.
