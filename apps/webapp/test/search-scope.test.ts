/**
 * GAP SEARCH SAYS WHAT IT SEARCHED, AT EVERY MOMENT.
 *
 * The shipped view offered the archive on Enter and answered with a toast: *"Searching the
 * server archive isn't wired up yet. These local results are complete."* Neither half was
 * true. `GET /search` was mounted, `cost: "read"`, RRF-ranked over `message_bodies.body_tsv`
 * and contract-tested, with zero callers; and the local index reads subject, sender and the
 * short snippet, which on the hosted service is a small part of stored body text.
 *
 * So the assertions here are about the two halves of the fix, in the order they matter:
 *
 *  1. the local pass still paints FIRST and with no round trip — that is the whole reason the
 *     local index exists, and replacing it with a network call would be a different product;
 *  2. at no moment does the view claim completeness it does not have. Four states, four
 *     sentences: only-local, archive-searching, archive-answered, archive-refused — plus the
 *     client that has no archive at all (`?demo=1`, and the desktop tier).
 *
 * ── THE COPY IS NO LONGER DECLARED HERE, AND THAT MATTERS ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This file used to carry an `O14_COPY` const, because `apps/webapp/messages/en.json` belonged
 * to another change when search scope landed, and it said in as many words: *"when they land, this const
 * is deleted and the spread below goes back to plain `messages`"*. They have landed, so it is.
 *
 * It is not tidying. A local copy of the strings means the tests assert against a fixture and
 * the product ships something else — which is exactly what a walk found on a live account: the
 * `=0` arm of `scopeDevice` had a test that exercised it and nobody had ever read the sentence
 * it produced underneath "Nothing on this device."
