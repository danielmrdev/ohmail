/**
 * THE AUTO-WORK OPT-IN'S SWITCH — the writer that mail 0040 shipped without.
 *
 * `screener-auto-suggest.test.tsx` covers what the flag DOES once it is on. This file covers the
 * only way a human can turn it on, which until now did not exist: the column, the route, the
 * service and the spender were all live and tested, and nothing in the UI wrote the flag, so the
 * feature was reachable only by a raw API call. That is the same shape as `dormancy_days`, which
 * has had zero writers since its own migration, and the point of this suite is that the second
 * instance does not become permanent the way the first did.
 *
 * ── THE SIX THINGS THAT MUST BE TRUE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. OFF BY DEFAULT, AND THE SWITCH SAYS SO. `autoSuggestAt: null` renders `autoOff` with the
 *     switch unchecked. A failed `GET /consent` renders the same thing — there is no path from
 *     "I do not know" to a control that looks armed.
 *  2. THE PRICE COMES FROM THE SERVER, AND NO PRICE MEANS NO CONSENT. Arming the switch issues a
 *     `dryRun` and leaves the confirm DISABLED until a `quotedCredits` lands. A server that
 *     answers without that field leaves it disabled for good, because an unknown cost is not one
 *     a person can consent to. The alternative — count × an assumed credit cost — is the guess
 *     the field exists to remove.
 *  3. THE QUOTE PRICES THE SET THE BATCH WILL ACTUALLY TAKE. The dry run's senders are the first
 *     `AUTO_BATCH_SIZE` of the SAME unsuggested queue the automatic path slices, in the queue's
 *     own order. This is the assertion that bites the plausible implementation: reading the queue
 *     the Screener's own control captures gives an EMPTY list on a tab that went straight to
 *     Settings, and a confirm reading "0 senders · 0 credits" over a batch about to buy ten is a
 *     lie in the direction of spending.
 *  4. IT ARMS THE WORK AND NEVER A DECISION. Across the whole flow the only requests are the
 *     consent read, the dry run and the consent write. No `POST /screener/:id`, no non-dry
 *     purchase, and no engine mutation — so no rule, no contact, no folder change, nothing moved.
 *     Undo is vacuous because nothing moved; credits are the only thing spent, which is why it is
 *     worth asking about at all.
 *  5. TURNING IT OFF DISARMS THIS TAB, NOT JUST THE DATABASE. Off, then open the Screener in the
 *     SAME tab without a reload, and nothing is bought. This is the criterion that fails if the
 *     switch ever writes through `api-client` directly instead of through the `useConsentState`
 *     the spender reads: the flag would be off on the server and still true in this tab, and the
 *     next Screener open would spend money the user had just revoked.
 *  6. THE WRITE CARRIES ONE FIELD. The PATCH body is `{ autoSuggest }` and nothing else, so a
 *     toggle cannot reset the dormancy window or the seed state on its way past.
 *
 * `apps/webapp` typechecks its tests, so the wire shapes below are checked as well as the values.
