/**
 * ═══ THE SPLASH SPENDS A REFRESH TOKEN, SO IT HAD BETTER BE THE RIGHT BROWSER'S ═══════════
 *
 * The resume splash is chosen by the EDGE, under the cookies of the request that asked for `/`.
 * Its effect does not run until that document has been delivered and hydrated, and the cross-tab
 * lock inside the refresh adds a second wait. Either gap is long enough for another tab to sign
 * in and replace the shared jar.
 *
 * What happens then is not a wrong screen. `POST /auth/refresh` ROTATES whatever session the jar
 * holds, so the splash spends the OTHER account's refresh token — and a rotation consumes it, so
 * that account's own tab can later present a consumed token and be read as reuse. The reload that
 * follows then opens their mailbox in a window that was selected for somebody else.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ACCOUNT COMES FROM THE SERVER ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A client-side read cannot see the gap, because it happens after it: by the time any code in
 * this document runs, the jar already says B. So the marker is read where the CHOICE was made —
 * `resume/page.tsx`, a server component — and handed down, and the comparison happens inside the
 * lock immediately before the request leaves.
 *
 * ── AND THE REFUSAL IS A RELOAD, NOT A SIGN-IN SCREEN ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * B is signed in. Sending them to `/login` would answer "you are already here" with the front
 * door; reloading lets the server serve whoever it now holds. That distinction is asserted below,
 * because a refusal that lands somewhere wrong is its own defect.
