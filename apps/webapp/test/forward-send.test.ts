/**
 * THE FORWARD'S PLAN AND WIRE — the pure halves of the inline forward, pinned key by key.
 *
 * `InlineReply` judges the Send lock with these functions and `AppShell.sendReply`'s forward
 * arm builds the mutation from them; these tests are what keeps that one derivation honest.
 * The lane tests pin `sendKeyOf`'s surface argument: a forward is ONE mutation shape sent
 * from TWO surfaces (the compose form and the thread's dock), and the lane is what keeps the
 * dock's "Sending…", its scratch-clear and its settle off the compose form's — see
 * `mail-send.ts` for the cleanup that branches on it.

 * ── A FORWARD'S BODY IS OPTIONAL, AND A REPLY'S IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Reported from real use: *"forwarding a mail enforces a message, a fwd mail must also be able
 * to be sent without a message."* `canSend`'s empty-body refusal was written for a REPLY, where
 * an empty body means the send carries nothing at all; on a forward the forwarded message IS the
 * content, and the note above it is the optional part. The refusal made the common case — pass
 * this along, no comment — unreachable from the one surface that offers it.
 *
 * The discriminator is `forwardOf`, which is exclusive with `inReplyTo` by construction
 * (`types.ts`), so nothing else in the predicate has to change and no caller passes a flag.
 * Every OTHER refusal still applies to a forward: no recipient, no sending mailbox, a send
 * already in flight.
