/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  A REFUSAL AT THE SINK IS NOT A MODEL FAULT — and the circuit used to count it as one.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `packages/core/src/ai/classify.ts` states the contract on {@link SensitivePayloadRefusal}
 * itself: *"a caller must never treat it as retryable, and the worker's circuit breaker must
 * never count it as an outage."* `ai-circuit.ts` caught EVERY throw from `inner.classify`,
 * incremented `consecutiveFaults` and tripped — so the sensitivity gate FIRING (the "Sensitive mail" invariant
 * failing closed, exactly as designed) was recorded as an Anthropic incident, and enough of them
 * withheld the classifier from the whole mailbox and flapped it through cooldown cycles.
 *
 * Nothing leaked: the payload is refused BEFORE `userPayload` exists. This is an availability
 * defect, and a comment stating the opposite of what the code did.
 *
 * ── WHAT A REFUSAL ACTUALLY MEANS, WHICH IS WHY IT MUST STAY LOUD ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `pipeline.ts` refuses sensitive mail BEFORE the credit gate and before the classifier is
 * touched (`!sensitivity.flags.no_ai && classifier && …`). So a refusal reaching the sink is
 * `classifySensitivity` and `screenOutboundText` DISAGREEING about the same bytes — the first
 * line of defence missed something the second caught. That is a defect report about our own
 * detector, not a fact about the model, and it must never be filed under `classifier_fault`
 * where an operator will read it as somebody else's outage.
 *
 * Every credential in this file is SYNTHETIC and matches the shapes already used by
 * `packages/core/test/ai/classify.test.ts`.
