/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  THE KNOWN-SET MEMO, AGAINST REAL POSTGRES AND A REAL IMAP SERVER
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `apps/worker/test/known-set-cache.test.ts` pins the classification and the drop rules at the
 * seam. Four claims cannot be made there, and each of them is why this file exists:
 *
 *  1. **THE MEASUREMENT.** How many times a settled mailbox reads `listKnownLocators` per cycle,
 *     before and after — the number the whole slice is for. A stub cannot produce it, because the
 *     read count depends on what a REAL cycle writes, and a real cycle writes a folder cursor every
 *     single pass.
 *  2. **A CYCLE SERVED FROM THE MEMO DECIDES WHAT THE DATABASE WOULD HAVE DECIDED.** Asserted
 *     through the adapter's own batch: a settled mailbox produces no creates and no moves, which is
 *     exactly the statement "every UID we hold is in the known-set the adapter was handed".
 *  3. **THE API TIER CANNOT MOVE THIS PROJECTION.** The memo's soundness rests on `observed_seen ??
 *     !unread` being invariant under the read-state writes a DIFFERENT process performs, which is a
 *     property of five service methods and one `ON CONFLICT` clause. It is checked here by driving
 *     the real `MessageService`, with a negative control beside it so the assertion has teeth.
 *  4. **THE LEADERSHIP DROPS NAME THEIR EVENT.** `runSyncCycle` drops the memo on ANY throw, so a
 *     test that only asserted "cold afterwards" would stay green with every specific drop deleted.
 *     These assert the RECORDED REASON, which is the only thing that distinguishes recognising a
 *     handover from catching its symptom.

   * ── 4b. AND THE CONSERVATIVE BACKSTOP, ON A FAILURE THAT WROTE NOTHING ────────────────────
   *
   * A database fault on a READ reaches no drop site of its own: nothing was written, so no
   * classified method ran, and no fence refused. Only the catch-all in `runSyncCycle` can drop the
   * memo here — which is exactly the case the rule *"any ambiguity, drop it"* is for, because a
   * cycle that died mid-flight may have died between a write and this process learning its
   * outcome. MUTATION-WATCHED: remove the `catch` and this goes red with a memo still warm.
