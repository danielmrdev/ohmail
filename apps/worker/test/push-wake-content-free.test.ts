/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  INVARIANT #1 / #5 — THE WAKE IS CONTENT-FREE, AND THIS FILE IS THE EVIDENCE
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A push wake travels through a THIRD PARTY: the UnifiedPush distributor the user chose, which is
 * very often somebody else's `ntfy`. Anything in that request is a fact about a person's mail
 * disclosed to an operator they have no relationship with — and a count or a folder name is a
 * fact, not a hint. So the payload is a closed constant, and "closed" has to be a thing a test
 * can fail on rather than a thing a comment claims.
 *
 * ── WHAT ENCRYPTION CHANGED ABOUT THESE CENSUSES, AND WHAT IT DID NOT ────────────────────────
 *
 * The sender now sends the same constant in one of TWO wire forms: sealed with RFC 8291 to the
 * device's own key when the registration carries `p256dh`/`auth`, and in the clear when it does
 * not. That breaks the ONE assertion these censuses used to lean on hardest — "the body on the
 * wire is byte-identical to the constant" — because a sealed body is necessarily different every
 * time: a fresh salt and ephemeral key per message, which is not a nicety but the thing that stops
 * an AES-GCM key/nonce reuse.
 *
 * So the census moved DOWN A LAYER rather than being weakened. What is pinned now:
 *
 *  1. THE CONSTANT — the literal and its byte length, unchanged.
 *  2. THE SOURCE — the sender's own code, comments stripped, may name no message-derived value,
 *     may carry exactly ONE request body, and may hand exactly ONE thing to the encryptor: the
 *     identifier `WAKE_BODY`. This is the census that goes red when somebody THREADS A SUBJECT
 *     THROUGH.
 *  3. THE WIRE, BOTH ARMS — the keyless request is compared in full and byte-for-byte to what it
 *     has always been; the keyed request is DECRYPTED with the subscriber's private key and the
 *     plaintext compared to the constant. The header DELTA between the two arms is a closed set,
 *     and the VAPID token's CLAIM SET is a closed set, because a signed token is the most
 *     inviting place in this request for a per-account value to hide.
 *  4. THE SEAM — the POST port's arity and the exact shape of its third argument, so there is no
 *     parameter a future edit could route content through without changing this file.
 *
 * ── HOW THIS WAS WATCHED RED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three separate mutations, because one is no longer enough to reach every arm:
 *
 *  · `body: sealed ?? WAKE_BODY` → `body: sealed ?? JSON.stringify({ type: "wake", subject: SUBJ })`
 *    — censuses 2 (two `body:`, a `JSON.stringify`, a `subject` identifier) and 3 (the keyless
 *    wire bytes) go red.
 *  · a `subject` threaded into the KEYS argument of the port — census 4's shape assertion goes
 *    red, and census 2's forbidden-identifier scan with it.
 *  · a `jti` added to the VAPID claim set carrying the account id — census 3's claim-set
 *    assertion goes red, and NOTHING ELSE DOES. That mutation is the reason the claim set is
 *    pinned here at all: it survives every other assertion in this file.

/**
 * The source with COMMENTS REMOVED — and the stripping is the load-bearing part of census 2.
 *
 * Without it the census is worthless in both directions. The module's own docblock says "not the
 * subject, not the sender" as part of explaining the invariant, so a naive text scan for `subject`
 * is red on a file that is CORRECT — and a census that is red when the code is right gets weakened
 * until it is green, which is how the guard stops guarding. Equally, a scan that only looked at
 * comments would pass a file whose comments were tidy and whose code was not.
 *
 * A small state machine rather than a regex: a regex that removes `//…` also removes the tail of
 * `"https://…"`, and the file does contain URL-ish strings. So string and template literals are

   *    that moment nothing bounded the request, and `resume()` drained happily for ever. Every

   *    listener makes that an unhandled `'error'` on an `IncomingMessage`, which in Node takes the
   *    PROCESS down — and it arrives after `post()` has already resolved, so the caller's own
