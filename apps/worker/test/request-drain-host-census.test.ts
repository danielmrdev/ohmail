/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  EVERY ORGANIZER `runSyncCycle` HOST DRAINS `_meta` — AND DOES IT AFTERWARDS (mail 0090)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `applyMetaRequests` (`apps/worker/src/request-drain.ts`) is only load-bearing if EVERY process
 * that runs `runSyncCycle` while organizing a mailbox calls it. A host that syncs as an organizer
 * and never drains is "built-tested-unreachable": the code compiles, `request-drain.test.ts`
 * proves the function itself is correct, and a reader's decision still sits in `ohmail/_meta` for
 * ever on that one host, silently, because nothing there ever calls it.
 *
 * `organizer-event-census.test.ts` is the precedent this mirrors — its own header states the
 * shape exactly: "a scanner that finds nothing is green, and a broken scanner finds nothing," so
 * the found set is asserted EXACTLY rather than as a lower bound, in both directions.
 *
 * ── AND THE ORDER IS PART OF THE CENSUS NOW ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The drain used to run BEFORE `runSyncCycle`, so a decision would govern mail arriving in the
 * same pass. That is inverted, and the inversion is a security property rather than a preference:
 * `ohmail/_meta` is a folder anyone with APPEND rights on the mailbox can write to, so a drain
 * that runs FIRST lets a flood of records delay — or with a slow enough database, indefinitely
 * postpone — the pass that reads somebody's mail. Reading mail is the product.
 *
 * A host could regress that by moving one call above another, in one file, with nothing failing.
 * So the ordering is asserted textually per host: the first `await runSyncCycle(` must appear
 * before the first `applyMetaRequests(`.
 *
 * ── WHY `await runSyncCycle(` AND NOT A BARER `runSyncCycle` ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The bare identifier also matches `export async function runSyncCycle(...)` — the DEFINITION, in
 * `apps/worker/src/sync.ts` — and a census that counted its own declaration as a caller would
 * either have to exempt that file by name (a birth-site-shaped hole) or silently expect `sync.ts`
 * to drain requests before calling itself.
 *
 * ── WHY `apps/worker/scripts` IS OUT OF SCOPE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A separate live-verification script calls `runSyncCycle` directly against a LIVE
 * mailbox for manual, human-run verification — it is not a process anything deploys. The
 * distinction the walk relies on is structural (`scripts/` vs `src/`), not a judgement call made
 * per file.
