/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  THE HOOK THAT FAILS INSTEAD OF THE ASSERTION
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A census, not a behaviour test, and it exists because the failure it forbids is INVISIBLE at
 * the place it is read. `truncateAll` empties 88 tables and, in a worker e2e `beforeEach`, runs
 * after a case that started a worker — so it also waits on the connections that worker is still
 * letting go of. At vitest's 10 s default `hookTimeout` the reset alone measured ~8.3 s for a file
 * resetting two databases: a large share of the budget, leaving whether a file is green or red to scheduler
 * load rather than to the code under test.
 *
 * What that looks like from the outside is the whole point. It does NOT say "the fixture was
 * slow". It says `Hook timed out in 10000ms` against every case AFTER the first worker case, and
 * on 2026-09-06 that cost a release-blocking investigation: `organizer-lease.e2e.test.ts` was
 * reported as a product regression in the organizer lease's own bookkeeping — a mailbox that
 * "never said why it was not syncing" — when the lease code was correct and the test passed the
 * moment it was run on its own. `release-stranded-claim.test.ts` had already hit the same wall and
 * written it down, and bought its way out with a per-file 60 s hook, which cured that one file and
 * left the cost everywhere else.
 *
 * So the two halves are guarded here together: the reset is ONE statement (the cost), and every
 * hook that runs it NAMES its budget (the margin). Neither half is observable from a passing
 * suite, which is exactly why a census is the only thing that can hold them.
