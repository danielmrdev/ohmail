/**
 * The time-scan proof PGlite cannot host.
 *
 * `workflowTimeScanPass` compared a raw-SQL left side against a JS `Date`. Drizzle has no
 * column type to infer from a raw-SQL expression, so the Date was bound UNTYPED and
 * postgres.js threw `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE: The "string" argument must be of type string …
 * Received an instance of Date` — on the FIRST select of the pass, against REAL Postgres,
 * on every single worker cycle. PGlite's driver accepts a Date happily, so the entire
 * existing suite was green while the live worker's workflow automation was dead: the throw
 * also skipped the `workflowDrainPass` that follows it inside the same try/catch, and the
 * worker cycle swallowed the error into `console.error`.
 *
 * This test runs the pass — and then the drain, in the same order the worker cycle runs
 * them — against the real :5433 Postgres. Restore the `lte(sql\`…\`, now)` form and it fails.
