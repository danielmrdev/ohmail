/**

 *
 * Two properties, and they are the ones PGlite cannot vouch for. The compare-and-clear is a
 * `WHERE sync_requested_at = <a timestamptz value>` — exactly the shape of fragment
 * `sync-stamp.pg.test.ts` records as binding differently under postgres-js than under PGlite — so
 * "the clear only clears the value it observed" is proven on :5433 or not at all. And convergence
 * (a stamp is never silently erased, so it is either served now or on the next pass) is a claim
 * about that same WHERE, which is why both live here rather than in a unit suite.
