 * a `fetchByUid`, so the gap row about it survived a fix and a close with nothing measuring either.
 * (1) the re-read commits through the ingest's own fenced door, so a removal landing while a
 * written-off UID is being fetched refuses the commit and stops the cycle. (2) the cycle's fence
 * raises `MailboxRemovedError` and the ingest repository raises `MailboxErasedError` — one fact,
 * two doors; `rethrowRefusal` names both and every arm with a sentence asks `refusalIsRemoval`.
 * PGlite measures the DECISION here; the lock order is `mailbox-fence-epq.pg.test.ts`'s.
