/**
 * `mailboxes.last_sync_at` HAD THREE READERS AND NO WRITER.
 *
 * Found by connecting a REAL IMAP mailbox to production: the worker synced it, created the
 * `ohmail/*` tree on the real server and the Screener moved a message into
 * `ohmail/Screener` — and `GET /mailboxes` still answered `lastSyncAt: null`, because nothing
 * in the codebase ever wrote the column.
 *
 * The cosmetic half is the (i) panel saying "not synced yet" forever. The half these tests
 * are about is operational: `evaluateAlerts`'s sync-lag rule measures
 * `coalesce(last_sync_at, created_at)` against a 15-minute threshold, so a permanently NULL
 * column means every mailbox is judged by its CREATION time. A perfectly healthy mailbox
 * crosses the threshold a quarter of an hour after it is connected and stays over it for the
 * rest of its life — the alert that exists to notice a dead worker instead fires for
 * everybody, forever, and gets muted. That is strictly worse than having no alert.
 *
 * ── WHY `.pg.test.ts` AND NOT THE UNIT SUITE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because `alerts.pg.test.ts` exists for a reason its own header spells out: the sync-lag
 * predicate compares a raw `coalesce(...)` fragment against a timestamp, PGlite binds a JS
 * `Date` happily, and postgres-js does not — the unit suite was green while every production
 * alert pass died. Any new assertion about this rule has to run through the real driver or
 * it is not evidence.
