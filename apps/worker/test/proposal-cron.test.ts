 *  THE EXCLUSIVE CLAIM ENDS WITH THE PASS, NOT WITH ITS TTL
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `propose` is exclusive per account: the pass that wins the claim is the only one that may
 * reach the model for its bucket, and the claim outlives a crash by a TTL. The claim was given
 * back on the THROW path only, so two costs stood:
 *
 *  · a pass that SUCCEEDED held its claim for the rest of the TTL, and the next pass over that
 *    account inside the window was answered `inflight` and skipped work that was already done —
 *    one wasted cycle per account per pass, self-healing and invisible;
 *  · a pass that never held the claim released it anyway — a loser of the race, a refusal, or a
 *    throw before the gate was reached — which takes the claim from whoever does hold it, in the
 *    middle of the model call it is paying for.
 *
 * So the claim is released on BOTH exits, exactly once, and only when this pass holds it.
