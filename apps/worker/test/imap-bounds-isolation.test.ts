/**
 * ═══ A SERVER-CEILING BREACH IS THIS MAILBOX'S FAULT, AND THE WORKER MUST AGREE ════════════
 *
 * The adapter's ceilings on server-chosen counts, sizes and waits do not build their own
 * isolation — they INHERIT it. A throw out of `runSyncCycle` is already attributed to the mailbox
 * it came from: that folder's cursor is held, the cycle fails, the connection closes, and the
 * mailbox accumulates toward its ordinary quarantine cadence while every other mailbox on the
 * shard proceeds. That is the whole acceptance for this class of defect, and the adapter's only
 * job in it is to raise an error the worker classifies as MAILBOX-LOCAL.
 *
 * ## Why that is not a free property
 *
 * The worker deliberately EXEMPTS some failures from per-mailbox blame, because a shared-service
 * outage rendered as "your mailbox is broken" is a measured incident: one database blip would
 * otherwise quarantine every mailbox on the shard in turn and write `status='error'` on each. So
 * `isSharedDatabaseFault` decides, and a breach that fell inside it would invert the isolation —
 * silently, and in the direction where nothing looks wrong: the hostile mailbox would be treated
 * as a victim of a shared outage, never quarantined, and free to keep costing the shard.
 *
 * ## AND THE MARGIN IS THINNER THAN IT LOOKS
 *
 * That predicate reaches `sqlStateClass`, which is `/^[0-9A-Z]{5}$/` on the error's `code` and
 * returns the first two characters as a SQLSTATE class. So the question "is this a shared database
 * fault?" is answered, for any unrecognised error, **by the SHAPE OF ITS `code` STRING.** A
 * five-character uppercase code is read as a SQLSTATE; anything else is not.
 *
 * `EIMAPBOUND` is ten characters, so it is not — and that is the entire reason this works. It is
 * a real safeguard and a fragile-looking one, which is exactly why it is pinned here rather than
 * left to the next person who shortens a code string for tidiness. The file this guards is in
 * another package and its author will not be looking at this predicate.
 *
 * MUTATIONS WATCHED RED AND RESTORED (2026-09-01), scripted and re-run — all three:
 *  · the refusal's `code` → `"22P02"`, a five-character SQLSTATE ⇒ red. It stops being unreadable
 *    to `sqlStateClass` and starts being read as a data exception, which is a claim about a
 *    message's bytes;
 *  · the refusal's `code` → `"CONNECTION_CLOSED"`, a driver code ⇒ red. That set is the
 *    database's, so the breach becomes a SHARED fault and this mailbox is never quarantined for
 *    it — the isolation inverted, in the direction where nothing looks wrong;
 *  · the classifier's `EIMAPBOUND` arm removed ⇒ red. The breach falls to the catch-all and
 *    innocent messages start earning durable failure rows.
 *
 * The second of those is the one worth reading twice. Both wrong answers are reachable by
 * SHORTENING OR RENAMING A STRING in another package, and neither would fail a typecheck or look
 * wrong at the site of the change.
