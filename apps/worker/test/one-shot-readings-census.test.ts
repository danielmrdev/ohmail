/**
 * EVERY ROLE CHANGE NAMES THE READING IT DECIDED FROM.
 *
 * `spendOneShot` treats an absent `asRead` as the old unconditional clear — the backstop posture
 * `fence` already documents for its own absence, which is what keeps every test caller working.
 * That makes the omission silent in production, where it IS the defect: a write that cannot date
 * its own decision erases a Stop pressed during it. So every call site in `apps/worker/src` is
 * counted, by the CALL and with comments stripped, and a new one reddens this rather than shipping
 * the unconditional clear back in.
