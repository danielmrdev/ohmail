/**
 * THE OHBOX TIDY PASS OPENS NO IMAP CONNECTION, AND STAYS INSIDE db + core.
 *
 * Both are about what this pass CALLS rather than what it computes, so both are source scans — a
 * behavioural test cannot see a code path it never enters, and the dangerous paths here are the
 * ones a future edit would add.
 *
 * The "Organize-in-place" invariant: organization lands in real IMAP folders, but only the worker's `reconcileFolders`
 * opens a connection to apply it — it holds the mailbox's adapter and its organizer lease, and a
 * bulk mover opening its own connection would be a second organizer for one mailbox, the exact
 * thing `ohmail/_meta`'s lease exists to make impossible. This pass writes `folder_state` desired
 * state, a `change_log` move and an `audit_log` inverse, and stops.
