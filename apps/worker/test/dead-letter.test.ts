 * ══ THE CYCLE LOOP'S QUESTION, AND THE ORIGIN TAG THAT MAKES IT ANSWERABLE ═══════════

 * records the residual it cannot close: postgres.js throws `code: "ECONNREFUSED"` when Postgres is
 * not listening, which is byte-identical to a dead IMAP host. Measured on the real :5433 — see the
 * table in `db-fault.ts` — three of the six database faults this worker can suffer are
 * indistinguishable from a provider fault by `name` and `code` together.
 *
 * So the cycle loop asks about ORIGIN instead, and these are the four claims that holds:
 *
 *  1. a tagged fault is shared HOWEVER it is coded, including the codes a provider produces;
 *  2. an UNTAGGED provider fault is still not shared — the boundary that keeps mailbox isolation
 *    intact, and the direction a wrong widening breaks first;
 *  3. `classifyIngestFault` sees THROUGH the tag, so wrapping the repo did not turn an outage
 *     into mail written off as unclassified;
 *  4. Postgres answering about the VALUE (SQLSTATE 22/23) is not shared, tag or no tag.
