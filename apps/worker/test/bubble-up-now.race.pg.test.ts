/**
 * "RESURFACE NOW" AGAINST THE WORKER'S BUBBLE-UP PASS, ON REAL POSTGRES.
 *
 * Two writers can now put a row into `resurfaced`: the worker's {@link bubbleUpPass}, when a
 * scheduled resurface comes due, and a person pressing "Now", which transitions straight there in
 * the request's own transaction. Everything below is about what happens when both of them have an
 * opinion about the same row.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS CANNOT BE A PGlite TEST ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PGlite is single-connection, so the whole hazard is unrepresentable in it: there is no second
 * physical connection to hold a row lock, `bubbleUpPass`'s guarded UPDATE can never be made to
 * re-evaluate its predicate against a row somebody else committed underneath it, and
 * `allocateSeq`'s row lock — the mechanism three production defects turned on — is uncontended by
 * construction. A green there would be a green from a simulator of the thing under test.
 *
 * ── THE THREE CLAIMS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. **"Now" SPENDS THE SCHEDULE.** This is the one that fails loudly for the implementation
 *     this slice exists to reject — "now" as `bubbled_up` with a date in the past. That row is
 *     still scheduled, so the next pass flips it a second time and the user gets a resurface they
 *     already dealt with. Here the schedule is gone before the response is written.
 *  2. **THE PASS CANNOT FLIP A ROW THE PRESS ALREADY TOOK.** Forced rather than hoped for: the
 *     press's upsert blocks on the flip's uncommitted row lock, so the two writes are genuinely
 *     ordered by Postgres and not by luck.
 *  3. **UNDER REAL CONTENTION THE LEDGER STAYS EXACT.** One `change_log` row per write that
 *     actually happened, seqs unique and gap-free. A gap means `allocateSeq` handed out a number
 *     whose transaction rolled back, and a `/sync` cursor that lands in it stalls.
