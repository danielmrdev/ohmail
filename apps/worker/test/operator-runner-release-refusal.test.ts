/**
 * ═══ EVERY OPERATOR RUNNER THAT WRITES ASKS THE SAME QUESTION FIRST ════════════════════════
 *
 * "Stop organizing this mailbox" is a refusal for the one-off tools too (mail 0088): a pending
 * release leaves the row `organizer` on purpose, so every lease-shaped check passes and a runner
 * that only asks the lease would renew the very claim the person asked removed and move their
 * mail. Two runners carried their own copy of that read and its sentence; a third would have been
 * written by copying one of them, and a fix to one copy would have left the other writing.
 *
 * So the read has ONE home — `run-cli.ts`, the scaffold — and this census refuses a runner that
 * takes the lease without going through it, by the CALL, parsed from source with comments and
 * literals stripped, never by the symbol merely appearing. The door is not one of its own
 * subjects: it holds the read and the sentence, and it is where the lease is taken from. A
 * runner reaches the lease through `takeRunnerLease`, but reaching past it to
 * `acquireLeasePermit` is the same intent to write and is measured the same way.
