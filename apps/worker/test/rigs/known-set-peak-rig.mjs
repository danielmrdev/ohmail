/**
 * WHAT THE WORKER RETAINS IN LOCATOR MEMOS WHILE N MAILBOXES ARE ATTACHED — read from the heap at
 * the PEAK of the attach pass, not from the size the pass settles on.
 *
 *   node --expose-gc --max-old-space-size=8192 \
 *        apps/worker/test/rigs/known-set-peak-rig.mjs \
 *        --mailboxes 16 --messages 100000 [--bound <bytes>] [--snapshot <path>] [--json <path>]
 *
 * A rig, not a test: it reports mebibytes, and a megabyte assertion inside a suite is a flake.
 * Run it from the repo root. It drives the REAL `KnownSetCache` through `tsx`, one instance per
 * synthetic mailbox, exactly as `index.ts` builds one per attachment.
 *
 * THE ROWS ARE HANDED OVER AND DROPPED. `makeRows` builds each mailbox's projection fresh and the
 * rig keeps no reference to it, so the memo is the sole retainer of those objects — which is the
 * production shape (postgres.js mints them per read) and the only arrangement in which the heap
 * figure is the memo's own. Keeping the corpus alive would charge the memo 8 bytes an entry for
 * its array spine and report a bound that holds for nothing.
 *
 * THE PEAK IS WHERE ALL N ARE WARM. The reading is taken with every memo still attached and
 * before any drop, because a bound enforced at the end of a multi-mailbox pass is no bound during
 * one. Two forced collects first, so a transient is told apart from a retainer.
 *
 * Every figure is SYNTHETIC: generated projections of a stated shape, never anybody's mail.
