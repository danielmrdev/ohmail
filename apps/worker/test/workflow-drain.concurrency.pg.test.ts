/**
 * The guarded-drain proof PGlite cannot host (it mirrors the `allocateSeq` concurrency test):
 * TWO worker drains on SEPARATE physical connections to a REAL Postgres (:5433) race
 * to claim the SAME pending run. The `pending → running` UPDATE re-asserts
 * `status='pending'`, so exactly ONE claims + runs it and the loser matches 0 rows —
 * a run can NEVER be double-executed even under the worker-cycle + cron-backstop race.
 *
 * ── ALSO LIVES HERE, AND NOT BY PREFERENCE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fix moves the charge and the paid model call OUT of the step transaction, so the debit
 * is committed BEFORE Anthropic is called. "Committed before" is a claim about visibility from
 * another connection, and **PGlite structurally cannot assert it**: it has one connection, on
 * which a read cannot tell committed from merely written-in-my-own-open-transaction. A
 * PGlite-only guard therefore passes just as happily against an implementation that still charges
 * inside the step tx — which is the defect. That is why the order guard is here.
 *
 * The overdraft guard is here for the sibling reason: `debitCredits`' `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` is the
 * serializer, and two callers cannot contend for one `credit_balances` row on a single connection.

 * card price for `workflow`), a flat 10 no longer buys the action under test and every
 * assertion failed as `insufficient` — a true statement about the fixture that says nothing about
 * the claim/charge/refund races this file exists to pin. Deriving the seed from the price keeps
