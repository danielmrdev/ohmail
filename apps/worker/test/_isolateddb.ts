 * THE RESET BUDGET — why the files below name a hook timeout instead of taking vitest's default.
 *
 * `truncateAll` empties 88 tables, and a worker e2e `beforeEach` runs it AFTER a case that started
 * a worker, so it also waits on the Postgres connections that worker is still letting go of. At
 * vitest's 10 s default `hookTimeout` that is not a comfortable margin, it is the whole budget:
 * measured on this machine, the reset cost 4.1 s per database before the single-statement TRUNCATE
 * above, so a file resetting two databases spent ~8.3 s of 10 s in the hook. Whether such a file
 * was green or red was therefore decided by scheduler load, and it failed as
 * `Hook timed out in 10000ms` on every case after the first worker case — which reads as a defect
 * in the code under test and is not one. It cost a release-blocking investigation on 2026-09-06,
 * where a lease test was reported as a product regression because the hook, not the assertion, was
 * what failed.
 *
 * The single-statement TRUNCATE took the reset to ~1.9 s per database; this budget is the second
 * half, so the margin no longer depends on how busy the machine is. It is NOT license for a slow
 * hook: a reset that genuinely hangs still fails, later and just as red, and the census in
 * `isolated-db-hook-budget.test.ts` is what keeps a new file from silently taking the default
 * again.

/**
 * THE STALE-DATABASE CHECK — why this fixture verifies a database it did not just create.
 *
 * These databases are long-lived: `prepareIsolatedDb` created them once, days ago, and every run
 * since has re-used them. `runMigrations` decides what to replay from the journal's `when`
 * (the folder millis), so a migration file EDITED IN PLACE — same `when`, new content — is
 * already recorded as applied and is never run again. The database then sits one column behind
 * this tree, for ever, and nothing says so.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical either. `0030_heartbeat_signals_alert_runs.sql` was amended four times
 * after it first ran here; one of those amendments added `worker_heartbeats.degraded_since`. The
 * isolated databases carried the pre-amendment `0030`, so the column was missing, so every
 * `writeHeartbeat` failed with `42703 undefined_column` — caught, logged `heartbeat_write_failed`
 * and otherwise ignored, because a beat is best-effort by design. With no heartbeat row, the
 * leader fence (`leaderStillOurs`) could not confirm this instance still led the shard, so EVERY
 * fenced lifecycle write was refused: `markMailboxSyncBlocked` returned false, and
 * `organizer-lease.e2e.test.ts` failed on the row never explaining itself. On 2026-09-06 that was
 * reported as a product regression in the organizer lease. Three layers of correct, defensive
 * behaviour composed into a failure that named the wrong component, and the database was a schema
 * older than the code the whole time.
 *
 * So drift is DETECTED rather than assumed away, and the detection itself is not this fixture's:
 * `journalDrift` in `@trafficflow/db/testing` is the one implementation, shared with the
 * SHARED-database entry points, and it answers only "is this database's schema the one this tree
 * declares". What to do about a yes is a POLICY, and there are two of them. This one is the
 * recreate policy: a database this fixture created for one test file IN THIS CHECKOUT is nobody
 * else's — which is true only because the name carries `checkoutKey()`. The shared
 * `trafficflow_test` cannot be dropped by whoever happens to notice, so its entry points refuse
 * instead — see `realPgAvailable` and, for the worker's own e2e door, `_workerenv.ts`.

 *
 * ── A NOTE THAT BELONGS IN THE WORKER'S FIXTURE, ABOUT A GUARD IN packages/db ──
 *
 * Since that change, `credit_ledger` carries a statement-level `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE OR TRUNCATE`
 * guard that raises on any attempt to rewrite the money trail — and it did its job here,
 * aborting this reset and with it every worker e2e file. Emptying a scratch database between
 * tests is precisely the case the guard is not aimed at, so the fixture steps around it. The
 * guard itself is untouched; that it fires is asserted in packages/db's own suite
 * (`credits.pg.test.ts`, `migration-0018.roundtrip.test.ts`).
 *
 * ONE named trigger comes off, not `DISABLE TRIGGER USER` across every table. The blanket form
 * worked, but it made this file a worked example of how to switch the money-path guards off
 * wholesale — including the deferred `*_coupled` constraint triggers that keep the ledger and
 * the balance in agreement. Naming the single trigger keeps the demonstration honest and the
 * blast radius one line wide.
 *
 * It comes off before ANY table is truncated, and that ordering is the point: `CASCADE` reaches
 * `credit_ledger` through foreign keys from tables that are not themselves guarded, so a
 * disable-truncate-enable done one table at a time would still fire the guard the moment some
 * earlier table cascaded into it. The whole thing is one DO block, hence one transaction — if a
 * TRUNCATE throws, the re-enable is not skipped, the disable rolls back with it.
 *
 * ── ONE `TRUNCATE` NAMING EVERY TABLE, NOT 88 OF THEM IN A LOOP ────────────────────────────
 *
 * This used to be `FOREACH t IN ARRAY tables LOOP EXECUTE 'TRUNCATE TABLE %I CASCADE'`, and the
 * loop is what made this fixture a flake generator. Measured on this machine against the worker's
 * isolated databases (88 tables): the per-table loop costs 4149 ms, one statement naming all 88
 * costs 1898 ms. A `beforeEach` that resets TWO databases therefore spent ~8.3 s of vitest's 10 s
 * default `hookTimeout` doing nothing but truncating — a large share of the budget — so whether a file was
 * green or red was decided by scheduler load rather than by the code under test. It presented as
 * `Hook timed out in 10000ms` on every case AFTER the first worker case, which reads as a defect
 * in the thing under test and is not one; `release-stranded-claim.test.ts` hit the same wall and
 * bought its way out with a per-file 60 s hook, which cures that file and leaves the cost.
 *
 * One statement is also strictly SAFER than the loop it replaces: Postgres takes the
 * `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` locks for all 88 relations in one deterministic pass, where 88 separate
 * statements acquire them one at a time and can interleave with another connection's ordering.
 * `CASCADE` stays even though every table is named — a table added later that is referenced by a
 * named one must still be reachable, and the whole point of the sweep is that it needs no list. */
