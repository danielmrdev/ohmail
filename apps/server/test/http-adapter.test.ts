/**
 * THE FOUR RULED CORRECTNESS POINTS of the hand-rolled adapter, each on a REAL socket — no
 * mocked IncomingMessage, no synthetic Request: the thing under test is precisely the
 * translation between the wire and the fetch types, so a fake on either side proves nothing.
 *
 *  1. `Readable.toWeb(req)` + `duplex:"half"` — a request body streams into the handler's
 *     Request (and a BODY-LESS POST arrives with `body === null`, which is what keeps
 *     `withRequestGuard` from demanding a Content-Type of `POST /auth/logout`).
 *  2. Multi-value `Set-Cookie` via `getSetCookie()` — a sign-in's five cookies reach the wire
 *     as five header lines, never one comma-joined line.
 *  3. Streaming response bodies — an SSE frame reaches the client WHILE the stream is open,
 *     not when it closes.
 *  4. Body byte cap (declared and chunked-lying variants) + headersTimeout/requestTimeout.

/**
 * ── A CANCELLED REQUEST BODY AND THE KEEP-ALIVE CONNECTION ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `handleServerRequest` decides how much of a request body to buffer from the ROUTE, and answers
 * 404/413 without finishing it when the answer does not depend on it — `readBodyWithin` cancels
 * the web stream, at zero bytes for a path the table does not serve and part-way for a body over
 * its route's ceiling.
 *
 * ── WHAT CANCELLING ACTUALLY DOES TO THE SOCKET, MEASURED ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The adapter builds the web body as `Readable.toWeb(req.pipe(cap))`. Cancelling that stream
 * destroys `cap` and UNPIPES the `IncomingMessage`; it neither destroys nor drains it. `pipe` has
 * already set node's `_consuming` flag, and that is the exact flag node's own end-of-response
 * `req._dump()` checks before draining — so it skips this request, the refused bytes stay on the
 * wire, and the next request on a keep-alive connection is parsed starting inside them.
 *
 * **Measured on a real socket, not reasoned.** The control below pipelines a second request
 * behind a cancelled body with no `Connection: close` and gets ONE answer where two were sent:
 * the connection is stalled until the request timeout. A handler that never touches the body at
 * all is fine (node drains it) — cancelling is what breaks it, and cancelling is what the door
 * does.
 *
 * Measured at 256 KiB rather than 4 KiB deliberately: a small body fits inside the transform's
 * own buffers and round-trips a pipelined request perfectly well, so the stall is SIZE-DEPENDENT
 * — the shape this repository treats as looking like flakiness rather than like a defect. The
 * 4 KiB form of the control passed while the defect was live.
 *
 * So the host answers `Connection: close` whenever it deliberately left bytes unread. It costs
 * one TCP connection per refused request, charged to the party that sent a body for a route that
 * does not exist or that broke the route's own ceiling.

   * The adapter's cap is four times any JSON route's ceiling here, so the request passes the
   * adapter untouched and `handleServerRequest` runs. `normalizeRequest` asks `bodyCeilingFor`
   * for `/snippets`'s own ceiling and `readBodyWithin` READS UP TO IT AND CANCELS THE REST —
   * which is what leaves unread bytes on a socket that node's keep-alive dump will not drain,
   * and therefore what `closing()` in `handler.ts` exists for.
   *
   * Its fingerprint is the opposite of the adapter's: `handler.ts`'s envelope names the route's
   * limit and carries the request id it minted.
