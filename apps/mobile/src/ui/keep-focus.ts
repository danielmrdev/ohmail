/**
 * THE CARET COMES BACK WITH ITS DIALOG. Android draws a `Modal` in a dialog window of its own, and
 * an unfold hands the composer a NEW one (measured: the dialog's window changed on every unfold,
 * never on a fold): the text survives, the field that held the caret does not. So the composer
 * remembers which field had it and, when its dialog is shown again, gives it back — unless the
 * person had let it go before the redraw (a blur longer ago than the redraw takes). The caret alone
 * is not the keyboard: the new window has no input focus yet when it is shown, so the keyboard is
 * asked for again once it has (`afterRefocus`, the native door on Android).
