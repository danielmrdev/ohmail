/**
 * ═══ A COMPOSER UNMOUNTED WITHOUT A CLOSE KEEPS WHAT A CLOSE KEEPS, Cc AND Bcc INCLUDED ════════
 *
 * The unmount keep (a fold or an unfold the reader hold does not stop) was written before new mail
 * carried copies, so it left `copiesToKeep(copies)` out and the engine wrote the kept draft with an
 * empty Cc and Bcc. The close keep and the unmount keep now build one request; only `quiet` differs.
