/**
 * MESSAGE-ACTION PARITY WITH THE WEBAPP — derived from the webapp's own source, not from a list
 * maintained here that could quietly drift.
 *
 * A reported defect this guard exists for (2026-08-22): "on the android app, opening a message
 * does give me only limited 3 action buttons and not the ones from our actual webapp / desktop
 * ui, this must be consistent UX". The webapp's reading pane is the reference surface (the
 * desktop composes the same shell, so it is consistent by construction); this phone's message
 * screen is the one that can drift, and it did.
 *
 * HOW THE VERB LIST IS DERIVED. `apps/webapp/app/shell/MessagePane.tsx` renders the action bar
 * from catalogue keys (`t("actionReply")`, `copy("actionLater", …)`, `tr("action")` for
 * Screening), and `MessageCard.tsx` carries the per-message Forward item (`tm("menuForward")`).
 * The regexes below lift exactly those keys out of the source, so a verb ADDED to the webapp
 * bar turns this suite red on the phone that lacks it — the settings-parity idiom: the webapp
 * file is the source of truth and this file has no list of its own to go stale.
 *
 * WHAT PARITY MEANS HERE, checked per derived key:
 *   1. the phone's copy deck (`src/copy.ts`) HAS the verb;
 *   2. its wording EQUALS the webapp catalogue's (`messages/en.json`) — same names, not
 *      near-misses (the phone ships one locale, English, mirroring the canonical deck; a
 *      second locale arrives with a phone i18n mechanism, which does not exist yet);
 *   3. the message screen's action surface actually REFERENCES it — reachable, not just
 *      defined. (Placement is the phone's own idiom — bar + sheets — and is not asserted.)
 *
 * THE ONE DOCUMENTED GAP rides {@link GAPS} with its evidence, and the guard holds the gap
 * honest from both sides: the webapp must still carry the verb (else the entry is stale) and
 * the phone must NOT render a control for it (a button wired to nothing is worse than an
 * absent one — `app/message/[id].tsx`'s own rule).
