/**
 * WHAT A MAIL ROW SAYS OUT LOUD ON THE PHONE — and that it says everything it draws.
 *
 * The row spoke sender, subject, stamp and read state; the conversation's count, the protected
 * capsule, the history place, the blocked tracker, the amount and the new-since chip were drawn
 * in silence. There is no React Native renderer in this workspace (`react-test-renderer` and
 * `@testing-library/react-native` are not dependencies), so the rendered label is reached the way
 * this suite reaches every other component fact: the sentence is measured by calling the
 * assembler, and the ROW is measured by parsing it — the label attribute must BE that call, and
 * every badge the strip renders must be guarded by a field the assembler reads.
