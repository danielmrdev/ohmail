/**
 * The list-foot tails must not make a claim the app cannot keep.

 * `ohboxTail` and `receiptsTail` once ended with "Search reaches the rest/older ones on your
 * server." — search over the synced mirror does not exist yet, so a paired user was told
 * search reaches server mail while it did not. The tails now state only what is on screen;
 * these tests pin the exact sentences so a server-search promise cannot ride back in on a
 * copy edit before the feature exists.
