 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `src/net/unified-push.ts` is the one file that touches the native module, and the native module
 * does not exist off-device: `requireNativeModule("ExpoUnifiedPush")` throws in node, and
 * `registerDevice` rejects on an emulator BY DESIGN, so even a simulator proves nothing. That is
 * exactly why the module is written as a port implementation — every behaviour that a test could
 * meaningfully assert lives in `push.ts` behind {@link UnifiedPushDistributor}, and this file
 * covers the two things that are true of the adapter itself regardless of platform:
 *
 *  1. IT LOADS AND DEGRADES. Importing it in node must not throw, and every function must answer
 *     the honest "there is nothing here" rather than propagating the missing module. This is the
 *     property that keeps the Settings screen alive on iOS and in every test run.
 *  2. THE PAYLOAD CONTRACT. The constant this app will act on, and — separately — the absence of
 *     the one field that would turn a silent wake into a visible notification.
 *
 * What is NOT claimed here: that a wake arrives, that a distributor forwards one, or that the
 * connector renders anything. Those need a phone with a distributor installed and they are named as
 * named as a device acceptance rather than pretended at.

 * the stub's distributor, iOS answers `null` — which it can only do by never having asked.
