/**
 * ═══ EVERY ROUTE'S TOP STRIP CLEARS THE STATUS BAR ══════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The door chooser drew its header with a fixed `paddingTop: 28` and no safe-area inset, so on
 * an iPhone the wordmark sat on the OS clock at every launch. The signed-in chrome was already
 * correct — `TopBar` and `DetailBar` both pay `insets.top` — which is exactly why nobody saw it:
 * the one route that renders NEITHER bar was the one route with no inset.
 *
 * So the rule is structural rather than per-screen: a route either hands its header to the
 * chrome, or it reads {@link useTopPad}. A fourth route added next week is covered the day it
 * lands rather than the day somebody launches it on a notched phone.
 *
 * The arithmetic itself is driven at a real inset below (59 px, an iPhone 14 Pro's), because a
 * census can only say WHERE the number comes from and never what it is.
 *
 * ── MUTATIONS WATCHED (each restored, `cmp`-proven) ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  · `paddingTop: top` → `paddingTop: 28` in `app/welcome.tsx`   ⇒ "every route" RED.
 *  · `topPad` returns `gap` instead of `insetTop + gap`           ⇒ "59 px" RED.
