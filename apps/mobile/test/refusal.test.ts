/**
 * ═══ A REFUSAL IS A VALUE, AND THIS IS WHERE ITS ARITY IS CHECKED ════════════════════════════
 *
 * `Refusal` names a deck key and carries `args`. The KEY is type-checked — a typo does not compile
 * — and the arity deliberately is not, because a mapped conditional type per arity reads worse than
 * the thing it protects. That trade is only honest if the arity is checked somewhere, so it is
 * checked here, at runtime, against every refusal the app can actually produce.
 *
 * The refusals are found by parsing the source for `refuse("key", …)` calls rather than by a list
 * somebody maintains: a list would drift, and the drift would be silent in exactly the way this
 * whole lane keeps finding.

 * EVERY REFUSAL THE APP CAN PRODUCE, read off the source rather than off a list.

 * Four things it used to miss, each of which made every assertion below vacuous for the calls it
 * could not see:
 *
 *  · **A KEY BEHIND A CONDITIONAL.** Only `ts.isStringLiteral(first)` was read, so
 *    `refuse(closed ? "a" : "b")` was skipped entirely — SIX keys in three call sites, none of
 *    them ever checked for deck membership, arity or an unfilled hole.
 *  · **AN ALIASED IMPORT.** The callee was compared to the literal text `refuse`, so
 *    `import { refuse as r }` would have hidden every call in that file. The local name is read
 *    off the import instead.
 *  · **`app/`.** The walk was given `src` only. Nothing there produces a refusal today; the point
 *    is that the first one would arrive unchecked.
 *  · **A KEY THAT CANNOT BE READ AT ALL** was silently dropped. It is recorded as unresolved now
 *    and fails, because a refusal nothing can check is exactly the one that breaks.
