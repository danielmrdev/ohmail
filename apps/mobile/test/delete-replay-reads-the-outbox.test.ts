/**
 * A DELETE WHOSE COMMIT REACHED THE OUTBOX IS NOT SAID LOST AT THE NEXT LAUNCH
 * (PHONE-DELETE-REPLAY-GONE-MAY-NAME-AN-OUTBOXED-DELETE). The window commits the delete into the

 * record, and the launch read the message absent (its own tombstone) and said "not moved to Trash"
 * while the outbox sent it. The real engine, press and wire over one device sqlite; the kill is every
 * timer cleared with nothing flushed, the server holding the DELETE.
