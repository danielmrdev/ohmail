/**
 * THE PHONE'S TWIN OF `apps/webapp/test/queued-is-said-in-the-shell.test.tsx` — same invariant,
 * same holder, driven against the same fixture name, on a real wire.
 *
 * `watched()` answered `status !== "rolled_back"`, so every verb that went through it read a
 * request the SERVER had merely RECORDED as a verb that happened: the phone said "Screened out"
 * over a rule nobody had written. Move and Delete were already awaited raw and already said it —
 * everything else was the unmeasured half, and the K32 landing measured that restoring the fold
 * verbatim left three suites and 50 tests green.
 *
 * The verbs driven here are the ones a 202 can actually reach (the adapter's own queued-capable
 * set): the screening ladder's rule writes, and the Screener release's retargets. A triage press
 * cannot be queued — its route answers 403 to a reader — so it is refused, not waiting, and that
 * ending already has its own cases in `message-actions.test.ts`.
 *
 * TO WATCH IT FAIL: in `live.ts`, `watched` → `p.then((r) => (r.status !== "rolled_back" ? {
 * kind: "applied" } : PRESS_THREW), …)` — the shipped fold — and every case here goes red on the
 * sentence while the positive controls stay green.
