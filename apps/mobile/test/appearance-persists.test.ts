/**
 * THE APPEARANCE THIS PHONE KEEPS — both axes or neither, and the ordering that decides what a
 * relaunch shows.
 *
 * Before this the scheme returned to Auto and the face pin was dropped on every launch, which
 * made the phone the one ohmail surface where a choice did not survive closing the app. The
 * store's own header says persisting the scheme without the face is the incoherence somebody
 * would report, so this file's first claim is that ONE record carries both.
 *
 * There is no React Native renderer in this workspace, so the ordering lives in a plain module
 * and is driven here directly rather than through a mounted provider.
 *
 * MUTATIONS RUN AND RESTORED (each named at its test):
 *  · `boot` publishing without the `chosen` guard → the press-beats-the-read test goes red;
 *  · `setTheme` persisting `{themePref}` alone instead of the live record → the pair test reds;
 *  · `publish` ignoring `dropped` → the disposed test goes red;
 *  · `decodeAppearance` returning the parsed object unchecked → the junk-halves test reds.
