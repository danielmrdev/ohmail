/**
 * ═══ THE AWAY RESPONDER ON THE PHONE ════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `PUT /away-responder` IS A FULL REPLACE. The route stores exactly the fields in the body and
 * defaults the ones that are absent, so a client that sends three fields silently resets the
 * other four — and the four it would reset decide WHO is answered (`audience`), WHICH mail
 * (`piles`) and HOW OFTEN. This phone edits three fields, which makes the full replace the whole
 * design problem rather than a detail of it.
 *
 * So what is measured here is the wire and the derived output a person reads:
 *  · a save carries the row that was READ, verbatim in the four fields this screen cannot edit;
 *  · no read ⇒ no save. A default row would be a shape the PUT then writes;
 *  · the 202 is not a failure and not a success: nothing was written here, the values on screen
 *    are the server's, and the sentence says the organizing install applies it;
 *  · the switch's four states, including an end date already past with the responder still on;
 *  · a pile this build has no word for reaches the screen VERBATIM, never filtered — a filtered
 *    list states a narrower scope than the responder acts on;
 *  · an unknown audience member reads as the WIDE one, so the sentence never claims more
 *    protection than the row gives.
