/**
 * THE ENGINE BOOTS ON THE MOBILE COMPOSITION AND REAL MAIL FLOWS.
 *
 * `bootEngine` is driven exactly as the connect screen drives it, with the platform half
 * swapped: `node:sqlite` behind the same `SqlExecutor` seam expo-sqlite implements, and the
 * adapter's default fetch talking to a REAL loopback HTTP server speaking the /sync contract
 * (snapshot bootstrap included). So the proof covers the whole substrate — composition → bearer
 * header → HttpAdapter → engine drain → SqlMirrorStore → sqlite — and the reopen at the end is
 * the phone's kill-and-relaunch: the mirror alone, no adapter, mail still there.
 *
 * The second suite is ruling risk 1: a dead sqlite host REFUSES, visibly. It must never fall
 * back to `MemoryMirrorStore` — that fallback boots, syncs and renders, and has silently turned
 * the app into a cold mirror that forgets everything on every kill. Reinstating such a fallback
 * in `boot.ts` turns these tests red (watched, not assumed).

/**
 * ── A MAILBOX REMOVED ON THE PAIRED DESKTOP LEAVES THE PHONE ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same invariant as the phone's OWN removal, on the paired path: a removed mailbox leaves
 * nothing behind. The server emits one `mailbox` delete when a mailbox's mail comes off the
 * store and the engine has always known how to sweep from it
 * (`client-engine/store.ts#cascadeMailboxRemoval`) — but the phone's `?types=` filter was a
 * hand-copied list written before that type existed, so the phone never asked for the receipt
 * and was never sent one. Its messages, drafts and cached bodies stayed, and a reconnect added
 * them again beside the originals.
 *
 * Its own server and its own world: the suite above shares one change log across cases, and a
 * removal is not something to leave in it.
 *
 * MUTATION-WATCH (edit the source, watch, restore):
 *  · drop `"mailbox"` from `SYNC_ENTITY_TYPES` (`client-engine/types.ts`) → both cases go red
 *    with the removed mailbox's message still in the mirror;
 *  · point the filter guard back at `MOBILE_SYNC_TYPES` instead of the declaration → the
 *    declaration arm passes for every value, which is the guard this replaces.
