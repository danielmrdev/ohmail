/**
 * THE PHONE'S EDITOR STAYS ON A DRAFT ANOTHER DEVICE SENT OR DELETED. The route
 * re-asked the live Drafts list on every render, so the row leaving it (sent or deleted) swapped
 * the open sheet for "This draft can't be edited here" and the sheet's own handling never ran.
 * The route's decision is driven directly (`compose-route.ts`), the rows come off `liveDrafts`
 * over `bootEngine`'s real HttpAdapter against the fake, and the wiring is READ (no RN renderer).
