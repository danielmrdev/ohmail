/**
 * ═══ THE PAIRED PHONE AGAINST A DOOR THAT CANNOT KEEP THE FOLDERS CHOICE ═════════════════════
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS BROKEN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A phone pairs with a desktop host, and `desktopHostRoutes` spreads `localRoutes`, which wraps
 * its consent group in `withoutFoldersFlag` — no folder verb is served on that table, so the
 * flag cannot be raised there. The wrapper used to force `foldersEnabledAt` to NULL on the read,
 * which every client reads as "off" and no client can tell from "off, and storable". So the
 * phone drew "Use folders", the press wrote, the PATCH echo omitted the axis, and
 * `writeFoldersEnabled` read that omission as `{ on: false }`: the switch flipped and snapped
 * back with no sentence anywhere. The webapp shell has never had this — its transport DECLARES
 * `foldersStorable`, which the phone has no equivalent of because its door is remote.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A TWIN AND NOT A FIXTURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The server side is the REAL wrapper (`packages/api/src/routes/local.ts`) over a handler
 * answering the consent row's real shape, served over real HTTP; the client side is the phone's
 * real parser. Neither is written to agree with the other — a fixture hand-shaped to the wrapper
 * would measure this file's author, which is exactly how the defect survived: the phone's own
 * fixtures answered `foldersEnabledAt: null` because that is what somebody assumed.
 *
 * The unwrapped arm is the positive control: the SAME handler on the managed table's shape,
 * where the axis is carried, must still store and read back.
