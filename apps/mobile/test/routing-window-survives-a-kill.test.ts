/**
 * A MOVE PRESSED INSIDE ITS UNDO WINDOW SURVIVES A KILL. The rule half of a Move is held for the
 * window; the journal holding it used to live in memory, so a force-stop lost the press while the
 * pill had said "Moved". Each launch below is a fresh module graph over the same device sqlite
 * (a new process), the kill is every timer cleared with nothing closed, and the reading is the
 * dispatch seam, the journal row on disk and the sentence the next launch says.
