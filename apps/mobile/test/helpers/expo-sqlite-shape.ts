/**
 * EXPO-SQLITE'S TRANSACTION SEMANTICS, ON REAL SQLITE — the platform double the node suite was
 * missing, and the reason a total defect could ship past 600 green tests.
 *
 * `sqlWorld` (pair-server.ts) drives `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync` in memory, whose `batch` is
 * FULLY SYNCHRONOUS: no other JS can run between its `BEGIN` and its `COMMIT`, so two writes can
 * never overlap and every concurrency question answers itself. The device does not work that way,
 * and the difference is not a detail — it is the whole of the Android body defect.
 *
 * What expo-sqlite actually does (`SQLiteDatabase.js`, `withExclusiveTransactionAsync`):
 *
 *   const transaction = await Transaction.createAsync(this)   // ← useNewConnection: true
 *   await transaction.execAsync('BEGIN'); await task(transaction); await …('COMMIT')
 *
 * `Transaction.createAsync` opens a **second connection to the same file**, and every step is a
 * real `await`. So two overlapping `batch()` calls are two connections both trying to write, and
 * expo's own documentation states the outcome: *"As long as the transaction is converted into a
 * write transaction, the other async write queries will abort with `database is locked` error."*
 *
 * This double reproduces exactly that, and it is NOT a mock of the failure: the connections are
 * real, the file is real, and the `database is locked` comes from SQLite itself. A double that
 * merely threw a chosen string would be satisfied by a fix that handled that string.
