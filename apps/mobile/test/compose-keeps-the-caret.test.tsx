/**
 * AN UNFOLD KEEPS THE CARET IN THE REPLY. Android hands the composer's `Modal` a new
 * dialog window on an unfold (measured on the lane AVD: the dialog's window changed on every unfold
 * and never on a fold), and the field that held the caret lost it with the old window. The composer
 * gives it back when the dialog is shown again — never on the first show, and never to a field the
 * person had already let go.
