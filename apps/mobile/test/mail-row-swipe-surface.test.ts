/**
 * THE SHAPE GUARD, AND IT IS ONLY THAT.
 *
 * Whether a swiped row is clipped and opaque is a fact about PIXELS, and this suite has no React
 * Native renderer — so the behaviour is measured on a device, by
 * the device rig's swipe-clip reader, which reads two frames of the same
 * row and refuses a row that draws past its card or lets the verb behind show through it. What is
 * kept here is the SHAPE that reading depends on, so a rewrite cannot quietly take it away: the
 * clip on the parent that does not move, the surface token on the one that does. Neither assertion
 * claims the visual fact; the frame reader does.
