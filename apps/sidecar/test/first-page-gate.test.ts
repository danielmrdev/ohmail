 * TRANSACTION — one admission for the whole body. Measured on a large mirror: a read
 * alone 180 ms, beside loose ingest statements 561 ms, beside one 4 000 ms ingest transaction
 * 4 178 ms. So on a cold start the boot drain sat in front of the first list row, ten runs of ten.
 *
 * The ordering is what this file holds, on both sides: the drain waits, and it never waits for
 * ever. Each case was watched RED against a mutation of the line that decides.
