/**
 * THE FIRST LOAD THAT SHOWS A MAIL LIST AND NO MAIL — the cloud door's body read, asked in the
 * window between the list arriving and the body walk reaching it.
 *
 * ── THE SEQUENCE, WHICH IS ORDINARY AND NOT A RACE ANYBODY HAS TO LOSE ──────────────────────
 *
 * A mirrored install fills in two passes, and `cloud-mirror.ts` says so in its own header:
 * messages travel on `/sync` and BODIES DO NOT ("they are not a `/sync` entity — the client
 * hydrates them separately"), so `backfillBodies` runs only after `drainSync` has returned. The
 * window between the two is not an edge case, it is every first launch: the list is complete
 * before its bodies are, and on a large account the replay behind it runs for hours.
 *
 * In that window the window's engine — `createLocalEngine()` in `apps/desktop/src/bridge-fetch.ts`,
 * `eagerBodies: true` — asks this process for the newest messages' bodies. And this is what it was
 * told:
 *
 *   1. `GET /messages/:id/body` matches `cloud-read.ts`'s local table, so it is served from the
 *      mirror by `MessageService.getBody`;
 *   2. that service proves ownership through `messages` (the row IS mirrored — it is why the list
 *      renders) and then LEFT-JOINs `message_bodies`, which has no row yet;
 *   3. its documented answer for that shape is "a message with no ingested body yields an empty
 *      body" — `200 {text: "", html: null}`. Correct for the hosted server, where an absent row
 *      means the body was never ingested. FABRICATED here, where it means "not copied yet".
 *
 * The client cannot tell those apart, and it does not treat the answer as provisional: an answered
 * body is `ready`, and `OhmailEngine.bodyPlan` never re-fetches a `ready` record. The mirror fills
 * in a minute; the window's copy of the mail stays blank for the life of the process. It is the
 * desktop window that hides how bad this is — its mirror is in memory and is rebuilt on each
 * launch, so quitting and reopening the app "fixes" it, which is exactly the shape of a defect that
 * gets reported as flakiness.
 *
 * The rule that closes it is already written, one file over, and merely applied too narrowly.
 * `cloud-read.ts`: "a read whose QUESTION is about what the mirror does NOT hold must forward,
 * however read-shaped it looks." A body the mirror has not copied yet is precisely such a read.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS TEST STANDS UP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing is mocked below the transport, the same standard `sidecar.e2e.test.ts` sets: a REAL
 * cloud sidecar over on-disk PGlite (`createCloudSidecar`), a REAL `OhmailEngine` + `HttpAdapter`
 * composed exactly as the desktop window composes them, and an in-process hosted API that holds
 * the body — because a hosted account always does — while answering the mirror's body walk with
 * nothing, which is the walk's ordinary mid-flight state.
