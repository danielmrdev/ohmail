/**
 * THE HOSTED MESSAGE COUNT — WHAT IT COSTS THE ACCOUNT TO KNOW IT.
 *
 * The window's strip can only say how much of the account this device is holding if this process
 * knows the second number, and the only place it exists is the hosted account. `GET /mailboxes`
 * will answer it — for `?counts=1`, and `packages/api/src/routes/mailboxes.ts` makes that opt-in
 * for one reason it states plainly: the count is a grouped aggregate over the account's whole
 * `messages` table, and the route is POLLED. This mirror polls every 20 s.
 *
 * So the interesting property is not "can it read the number" — it is "how often does it ask".
 * These tests drive the real `refreshMailboxes` through real pulls with a controlled clock and
 * COUNT the counted requests. An implementation that asked on every refresh would pass every
 * functional test in this suite and put 180 full-table aggregates an hour behind one install.
 *
 * Mutation-checked, all three shown red:
 *  · make `countsWanted()` always true            → the floor and budget cases go red;
 *  · drop the `countsAskedAt` stamp               → the counts-less-account case goes red;
 *  · stop clearing `sawBacklog` after a counted ask → the spent-backlog case goes red.
