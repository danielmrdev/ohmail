 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  `start()` MUST NOT LEAVE AN AUTHENTICATED IMAP LOGIN BEHIND
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `connect()` LOGS IN and then LISTs (`packages/core/src/adapters/imap.ts`), so every line after
 * it in `start()` runs with a live authenticated socket that only `stop()` can close — and
 * `apps/sidecar/src/main.ts` answers a rejected `start()` by LOGGING it and continuing to serve
 * the mirror, deliberately (§8: a first sync taking minutes must not make the UI look broken).
 * The two facts compose into a leak: a post-connect throw left the login open for the life of the
 * process, with no handle anywhere that could close it.
 *
 * ── WHY A DESKTOP LEAK IS NOT THE SAME SIZE AS A SERVER ONE ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * iCloud caps concurrent IMAP connections per account, and a desktop user's other clients
 * (Apple Mail, their phone) are already spending that budget. One leaked login on a laptop that
 * relaunches after every crash is a mailbox that eventually refuses to connect at all, and the
 * error the user sees is on the WRONG app.
 *
 * ── THE PATTERN IS NOT NEW HERE, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS A GUARD AND NOT A DESIGN ─────────────
 *
 * `packages/api/src/send-adapter.ts:68-71`, `packages/api/src/attachments-adapter.ts:36-41` and
 * `apps/worker/src/index.ts:1163` all close-then-rethrow around exactly this window. The sidecar
 * missed it. These claims pin the sidecar's copy so it cannot be missed again.
 *
 * ── WHY GREENMAIL AND NOT A FAKE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A counting fake would prove that `close()` was CALLED. The defect is about a SOCKET, so the
 * adapter under test is a real `ImapAdapter` against the real server the rest of this package's
 * e2e uses (`docker-compose.yml`, port 3143) with ONE method sabotaged, and the assertion is that
 * the server-side session is gone afterwards — asked by issuing a real IMAP command on it.
 *
 * Nowhere near a real mailbox: a fresh random GreenMail user per test.

   *
   * This case used to read *"holds no login either"* and assert an UNUSABLE session after both
   * launches. That was true of the model it was written in, where standing down meant stopping:
   * a stood-down install organized nothing, polled nothing and had no use for a connection, so a
   * login it still held was a leak.
   *
   * The loser is a READER now. The symmetric-takeover ruling: the stand-down leaves the
   * install its *"row, credentials, mirror"*, it *"reads the mailbox from now on"*, and it keeps
   * its login and its poll timer to do that with. Closing the socket here would not close a leak;
   * it would stop the mirror growing, which is the whole product difference the reader mode
   * shipped for. So the assertion inverts, and it is still a guard: a build that closes on the
   * stand-down path fails here, and it is a build in which a demoted desktop silently stops
   * receiving the user's mail.
   *
   * What that does NOT license is holding a login for a launch that FAILED — the two cases above
   * are that claim, and this one is what tells the two apart: a stand-down is not a failure.
   *
   * `apps/sidecar/test/organizer-lease.e2e.test.ts` covers the DECISION for this launch (it
   * chooses no placement, claims nothing, and the row outranks the empty folder). This adds the
   * connection.
