/**
 * THIS INSTALL DECLARES THAT IT HAS NO PLATFORM CEILING ON ATTACHMENT BYTES.
 *
 * The 3 MB attachment limit in `SendService` is the HOSTED API's serverless request-body limit
 * expressed in raw bytes — attachment bytes ride a JSON request there, base64, so 3 MB of raw
 * bytes encodes to a little more and still clears the platform's body cap. None of that describes this process:
 * the compose form, the send handler and the SMTP dial are all in it, there is no request body
 * anywhere between them, and the only ceiling that exists is the one the user's own submission
 * server announced.
 *
 * So the local service bag declares `sendSurfaceMaxTotalBytes: null` — "no platform ceiling" —
 * and `SendService` then caps a send at whatever the mailbox's server said, or at the 3 MB
 * constant while nothing has been measured.
 *
 * ── WHY THE DECLARATION IS ASSERTED FROM SOURCE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `localServices` is module-private and building one needs a key provider, an auth config and a
 * send adapter — an engine's worth of setup to observe one property of one object literal. What
 * regressed in this family before is exactly that: a property missing from a literal. Comments are
 * stripped first, because the prose in this repository quotes the code it describes and an
 * assertion a comment can satisfy is worth nothing.
 *
 * The second half is the one that matters more than the declaration: `null` must select the LOOSE
 * branch only where a measurement exists. An install whose server has never been probed has no
 * measured ceiling anywhere, and the answer there is the strict constant — an unknown limit read
 * as no limit costs the user a message they composed and waited for.
