/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  THE LOCAL DOOR'S CREDENTIAL CLEAR PROVES ITSELF — the desktop's sign-out rests on it
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `DELETE /local/stored-login` is the only way the mailbox password leaves this machine: it is
 * sealed inside the mirror's database, only the engine can reach it, and the desktop shell
 * deliberately leaves both the mirror and this install's key in place. So the shell's whole
 * sign-out — including its refusal arms, which stop and report on a non-2xx AND on an engine
 * that could not be reached — is exactly as good as this endpoint's 200. Those two arms are
 * why the throw below is enough: it reaches the shell as a bridge error rather than as a status
 * line (see the case that says so), and the shell refuses either way.
 *
 * It issued the DELETE, logged `stored_login_cleared` and answered 200 without ever asking
 * whether the row was gone, so a delete that removed nothing read identically from outside to
 * one that worked — and the shell, seeing the 2xx, stopped the engine and removed `config.json`
 * with its own refusal arm never reached.
 *
 * ── AND WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * These cases pin the statement ORDER inside one transaction. They cannot see a credential
 * writer that WAITS on the locked row and commits after this transaction does — that is the
 * durable `signed_out_at` stamp's half, driven in `signed-out-stamp.test.ts`. Saying so here
 * rather than letting the word "fence" imply it: a guard that claims more than it checks is the
 * thing this whole slice is about.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A SOURCE CENSUS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `forgetStoredLogin` is a closure inside `startEngine`, reachable only by standing up a whole
 * local engine on a real PGlite directory — and the property is not a value it returns but the
 * SHAPE of its critical section: one transaction, a locking read, the delete, a read-back, and
 * a throw. That is a structural fact, which is what this repository uses a census for
 * (`privacy.test.ts` and the release-minification census are the same instrument). What a
 * census cannot claim is that PGlite's `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` serializes a competing writer the
 * way Postgres does; what it does claim is that the code asks for it, and that the answer is
 * READ rather than assumed.

 * Comments explain the very shapes this forbids, so the negative checks read code only — and

 * from there to the next terminator. A negative asked about an extract that is not there passes
 * for nothing, and nothing says so.
