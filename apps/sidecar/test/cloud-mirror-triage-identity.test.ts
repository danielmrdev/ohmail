/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  A TRIAGE STATE KEEPS ITS HOSTED IDENTITY THROUGH THE CLOUD-DOOR MIRROR
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `message_states` is the ONE table this mirror inserted WITHOUT the hosted row's id (its
 * conflict target is the unique `message_id`), so the local row was minted a fresh uuid while
 * `applyPage` recorded the local change-log row under the HOSTED id. The local `/sync` then
 * materializes by `message_states.id`, found nothing, and — by the delta contract — served the
 * change as a DELETE TOMBSTONE. So on a Cloud-door desktop NO triage state ever reached the
 * window: every `message_state` change was announced and then withdrawn in the same breath.
 *
 * What the reader saw is the whole of the report. `MessageDTO.triage` is a projection joined off
 * `message_states` BY MESSAGE ID, so it landed correctly — the row kept its "Back Tuesday 09:00"
 * chip. But `parkedMessageIds` and `triagePiles` read the `message_state` ENTITY, which was
 * absent, so nothing was held out of the Ohbox and nothing was listed under Resurface. Mail parked
 * until Tuesday sat in the Ohbox, unread, wearing the date it was waiting for; the Resurface pile
 * showed only a stale local overlay from a triage done on that machine. Web and desktop
 * disagreed on the same account, on the same selectors, because one of them was missing an entity.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SUITE DID NOT SEE IT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `cloud-mirror.test.ts` drives `change("message_state", msgId, …)` — the wire id spelled as the
 * MESSAGE id — and asserts the local ROW landed. Production spells that id as the
 * `message_states` row's uuid (`SyncService.getSnapshot` emits `s.id`; `TriageService.setState`,
 * `MessageService.markSeen` and `bubbleUpPass` all record `entityId: row.id`), and the assertion
 * stopped at the row rather than following it out through the local feed. `sweepPhantoms` states
 * the same false premise in a comment — "`message_state`'s /sync id is its messageId" — so the
 * fixture and the code agreed with each other and not with the server.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS ASSERTED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The wire id here is a uuid DISTINCT from the message id, which is the production shape and the
 * one thing the old fixture could not express. Then: the identity is carried into the local row;
 * the local feed answers with the ENTITY rather than a tombstone; and the window's own store,
 * fed that feed and read through the shipped selectors, holds the not-yet-due message under
 * Resurface and in none of the three Ohbox groups.
 *
 * The last arm is the invariant rather than the case: NO change this mirror records may come back
 * from the local feed as a delete. A re-keyed entity of any type fails there without anybody
 * having to think of it.
 *
 * ── HOW TO WATCH IT FAIL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * In `cloud-mirror.ts`'s `applyUpsert`, `case "message_state"`, drop `id: s.id ?? ch.id` from the
 * insert values and from the conflict `set`. Every arm below goes red: the local row carries a
 * random id, the feed answers `message_state` as a delete, the pile is empty and the parked row
 * stands in the Ohbox. That mutation was run.
