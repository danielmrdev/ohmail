/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  EVERY WRITER THAT SEALS A MAILBOX PASSWORD READS THE SIGN-OUT STAMP
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A sign-out stamps `mailboxes.signed_out_at` in the same transaction as the credential delete,
 * and a write that began before that stamp refuses (`packages/services/src/signed-out-fence.ts`).
 * The rule is only as good as its coverage: one writer that seals a secret without reading the
 * stamp is a door a sign-out does not close, and nothing else in the tree would say so — the
 * engine's own epoch is per-process, so an ungated writer simply works.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS COUNTED, AND WHAT IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A CALL, found by parse rather than by filename: every `insert(mailboxCredentials)` and
 * `update(mailboxCredentials)` in the two roots a standalone install runs, classified by whether
 * the object it writes names `secretEnc`. A write that carries no secret cannot put a password
 * back, so it is recorded META-ONLY and left alone — the seed's server backfill is one, and this
 * file is where that classification is stated rather than assumed. A DELETE is not a write.
 *
 * The gate must sit in the SAME BLOCK as the write, one level up and no further: a fence in an
 * outer block is a fence a branch can step around.
 *
 * ── THE POSITIVE CONTROL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fixture below holds all three shapes — gated, ungated, meta-only — so a green here is a
 * detector that discriminates rather than one that found nothing. Measured: with the fence call
 * deleted from `upsertCredOn`, the services root reads one UNGATED site and this file is red.
 */

/**
 * AND THE ERASURE'S STAMP, on the same rule. A mailbox erasure leaves the row as its tombstone
 * and deletes the credentials, so a writer that does not read `mailboxes.erased_at` re-mints a
 * password for a mailbox somebody removed — a live way back into it. The sign-out's argument one
 * column over, measured the same way and in the same block: a door is closed when it reads BOTH.
