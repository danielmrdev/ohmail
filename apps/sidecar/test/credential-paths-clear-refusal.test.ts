/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  EVERY CREDENTIAL PATH REACHES THE ACT THAT CLEARS A REFUSED SIGN-IN
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A refused sign-in suspends the automatic re-dial — four LOGIN attempts a minute is how a
 * wrong password becomes a locked account — so the flag has to be cleared by whatever replaces
 * or removes the password. `engine.ts` stated that as already true and it was not: the seal
 * route re-points every mailbox but the SEED by detaching it, and a one-mailbox install is the
 * seed, so its new password was stored while its runtime went on dialling the old one with the
 * re-dial suspended for ever. This file is the check that statement now names.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS COUNTED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every `insert`/`update`/`delete` of `mailboxCredentials` in the standalone engine, found by
 * parse over source with comments and string literals blanked, and each one has to fall inside
 * a region declared below with how a stale refusal is prevented on it. A write outside them all
 * is the new path nobody classified, and it reads red with its line.
 *
 * ── THE CONTROLS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The regions are proved to BOUND: `discardCredentialsFor` is a bare delete and must NOT hold
 * the clearing call, so a matcher that returned the whole file cannot pass. The fixture at the
 * foot holds the gated and ungated shapes. Measured red by deleting `live.credentialReplaced()`
 * from the seal route and by deleting `clearSignInRefusal` from the purge the sign-out calls.
