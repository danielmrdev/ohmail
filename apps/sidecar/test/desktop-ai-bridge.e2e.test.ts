/**
 * THE WINDOW'S OWN CODE AGAINST THE REAL ENGINE — the join neither side's suite covered.
 *
 * The desktop app's tests drive its settings client and its suggest loop against a stand-in engine;
 * this engine's tests drive its routes through a client written beside them. Both were green while
 * the two could not actually talk: the window addresses the engine with root-relative paths, and
 * the engine builds what arrives with the platform's `Request`, which rejects one. Every layer
 * agreed with itself and nothing checked the seam.
 *
 * So this drives the SHIPPED window modules — `local-ai.ts` and `local-suggest-run.ts`, exactly as
 * they are compiled into the app — against a REAL engine on a REAL mailbox, through a stand-in for
 * the native shell that does what the native shell does and nothing more: compose the path against
 * the base the engine announced, add the session token the window never sees, and hand the answer
 * back as bytes. The shell's half of that is pinned separately, in Rust, against a child process
 * over a real pipe (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/engine_tests.rs`).
 *
 * ── THE MODEL IS THE ONE THING STANDING IN ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Injected at the transport, so what is asserted is the request that would have left this machine —
 * its address, its headers, and that it happened at all. A test that reached a real endpoint would
 * spend somebody's money on every run and fail for reasons that have nothing to do with this code.
