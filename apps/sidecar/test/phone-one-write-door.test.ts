/**
 * ONE DOOR INTO THE PHONE'S STORE — measured on the composition a device runs.
 *
 * The device store is one serialized connection behind a drizzle sqlite-proxy, and that proxy
 * issues `begin`, the statements and `commit` as SEPARATE calls. `oneTransactionAtATime` queues
 * whole transactions; a statement issued straight on the handle is not in that queue, so it lands
 * between somebody else's `begin` and their `rollback` and is undone after its caller was told it
 * succeeded. The person sees the edit, reloads, and it is gone.
 *
 * The announcement half has the same root on the read side: the dialect's own contract says a
 * notification is "delivered when the transaction commits", and the SQLite arm delivered it at the
 * call, so a listener could be woken for a row that rolled back.
 *
 * ── THE FIXTURE'S ONE CONTRIBUTION IS THE YIELD ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `node:sqlite` is SYNCHRONOUS, so a double built straight onto it cannot express the interleaving
 * the device's asynchronous driver has: with no yield the hazard is unreachable here and this file
 * would be green against the shipped code. Awaiting a macrotask in every call is what makes the
 * queue load-bearing rather than decorative — the reason `phone-engine-boot.test.ts` gives for the
 * same fixture.
 *
 * ── IT RUNS UNDER THE SQLITE PROJECT, AND THE OTHER RUN SAYS SO ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The services are typed against the server twin and the device twin is substituted by
 * `vitest.sqlite.config.ts`; under the default project the first statement dies on
 * `gen_random_uuid`. So the default run gets a PREMISE CASE rather than a silent skip.
