 * The released 0.20.0 wedged every fresh paired desktop's first pull: mail 0118 gave `approvals`
 * a key into `routing_decisions`, and the hand-kept `APPLY_ORDER` applied approvals first, so the
 * page aborted on 23503 for ever. That key is declared in the migration and not in the drizzle
 * schema, so the pairs are read from the migrated store's own catalog — the constraints that
 * refuse the write. The one hand-kept fact is which tables each arm of `applyUpsert` writes.
