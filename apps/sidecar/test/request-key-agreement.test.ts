/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  THE THREE DOORS MUST DERIVE THE SAME KEY, AND NOTHING TOLD THEM WHEN THEY DID NOT
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A decision travelling between two installs is signed with a key neither of them is sent: each
 * derives it from the mailbox credential it already holds. That works exactly as long as all three
 * doors derive from the SAME secret, and there is no key-agreement check anywhere in the product —
 * a mismatch does not error, because HKDF over the wrong password is still a perfectly good key.
 *
 * **What it produces instead is the worst available failure.** Every record refuses as
 * `unauthenticated` — the same answer a forgery gets — so a person sees decisions time out
 * reporting that nobody took them while both installs are live and correct, and the log names an
 * attack. There is no signal anywhere that says "these two installs disagree about the key".
 *
 * So the agreement is asserted here instead, from ONE fixture, against the exact shapes the three
 * call sites pass.
 *
 * ── THE RULE, AND THE BUG IT REPLACES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * DERIVE FROM THE CREDENTIAL YOU OPENED THIS MAILBOX WITH.
 *
 * The hosted worker held that by construction (`deriveRequestKey({ auth: creds.imap.auth, address:
 * mb.address })` — the per-mailbox credential it decrypted) and so did the single-mailbox cron (the
 * env credential it dials with). The sidecar did NOT: it derived from `config.imap.auth`, the
 * SEED's configured credential, for every mailbox it attached — while dialling #2..N from their own
 * stored credentials. So a local install with a second mailbox signed with one password and opened
 * the mailbox with another.
