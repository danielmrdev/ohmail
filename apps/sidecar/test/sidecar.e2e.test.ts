/**
 * THE HEADLESS END-TO-END — the project's design notes, step 4.
 *
 * "Start with the headless end-to-end: sidecar assembly (`createApp` + on-disk PGlite +
 * `ImapAdapter` + the sync loop) against **GreenMail**, which de-risks PGlite and the whole
 * assembly before any UI or packaging."
 *
 * This is that test, and it is the one that decides whether the desktop tier is a real mail client
 * or an interface preview. Nothing here is mocked below the transport:
 *
 *  · a real IMAP server (GreenMail on 3143, `docker-compose.yml`), reached over a real socket;
 *  · a real message, appended by a separate ImapFlow client, as a stranger would send it;
 *  · the real pipeline — `runSyncCycle` from the worker, `planChange`/`commitChange`, the Screener
 *    rule that files first contact — writing to a real on-disk PGlite;
 *  · the real `createApp(apiRoutes)` behind the real stdio frame codec;
 *  · the real `HttpAdapter` + `OhmailEngine`, unmodified, given nothing but a `fetch`.
 *
 * The assertions that matter are the ones about the SERVER. Organize-in-place (the "Organize-in-place" invariant)
 * means the organization is not a row in our database, it is where the message physically sits in
 * the user's mailbox — so this checks the folder with a second, independent IMAP client, the way a
 * user checking in Apple Mail would.
 *
 * Docker is a hard requirement, deliberately and consistently with
 * `packages/core/test/adapters/imap.changes.test.ts`: a skip here would let the whole slice go
 * quietly unexercised, which is the state the project's design notes describes the desktop apps as
 * having been in all along.
