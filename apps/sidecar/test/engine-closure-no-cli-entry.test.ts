/**
 * NO MODULE THE ENGINE BUNDLES MAY RUN A COMMAND WHEN IT IS MERELY IMPORTED.
 *
 * The engine ships as one bundled file. A bundler rewrites every module's `import.meta.url` to the
 * URL of the OUTPUT it produced, so inside the bundle every module claims to be the file the user
 * ran — and the ordinary Node idiom for "was I run directly?", comparing `import.meta.url` with
 * `process.argv[1]`, is therefore TRUE for every module in the bundle that carries it.
 *
 * That is not a theoretical hazard. The `organize-here` command's guard sat at the bottom of the
 * module that also holds the takeover logic the engine imports. The day the engine started
 * importing that logic, the command began running inside the engine on every launch: it opened the
 * local database and took the data directory's exclusive lock before the engine's own startup
 * could, so startup then refused — correctly, since that lock is what stops two writers on one
 * mirror — and the engine never served on any platform. Its success path was `process.exit`, which
 * would have ended a packaged app's engine at launch instead.
 *
 * The remedy is a shape, not a patch: the half that RUNS lives in a file of its own that nothing
 * imports (`*-cli.ts`), and the half that is importable holds no guard. This test holds the tree to
 * that shape, because the engine's import closure grows and the next module to join it is the one
 * nobody will think to check.
