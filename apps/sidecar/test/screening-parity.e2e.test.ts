/**
 * THE DESKTOP ASKS THE SAME SCREENING QUESTION CLOUD ASKS — proved on the wire, both providers.
 *
 * The Screener's suggestion path stopped asking the ROUTING question: `ohmail/Screener` is what the
 * routing taxonomy DEFINES as the answer for a first-contact sender, and every row that path can
 * reach is a first-contact sender, so the model was being asked a question with its answer built in
 * and gave that answer most of the time. `ClassifierPort` grew a second method, `screen`, for the
 * question a person standing at the gate is actually asking.
 *
 * That method is OPTIONAL on the port — a compatibility statement, because a `ClassifierPort` is
 * implemented outside the package that declares it — and `ScreenerService.suggest` falls back to
 * `classify` when it is absent. The fallback degrades advice without endangering anything, which is
 * exactly what makes its absence invisible: a standalone install whose providers had never been
 * taught the second question kept answering the first one, correctly, forever, and nothing failed.
 *
 * So this file asserts the QUESTION rather than the answer, at the transport, for both of the two
 * ways a standalone install reaches a model.
 *
 * ── WHAT EACH ASSERTION IS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  · **The drift guard.** The prefix on the wire is compared BYTE FOR BYTE against the constant
 *    `@trafficflow/core/mail` exports. Not "contains a phrase" — identical. Two hosts asking one
 *    question in two slightly different wordings is a defect no test of either host alone can see,
 *    because each passes its own; the only way to catch it is to compare against the shared source.
 *    Mutation: append a sentence in either provider, or swap the import for a local string, and
 *    both providers go red here.
 *  · **The question is the screening one and not the routing one.** Asserted twice over: the prefix
 *    is not `TAXONOMY_PREFIX`, and the answer set on the request is the five-pile screening one
 *    with `ohmail/Screener` REMOVED. The second is the sharper of the two — the removal of that
 *    label from the enum is the whole mechanical difference between the two questions.
 *  · **The user's own words reach the model.** The account's bar travels in the USER turn, never in
 *    the cached prefix, and on this question it is binding criteria rather than one input among
 *    several.
 *  · **AND THE INSTALL CAN SET THEM.** The bar is no longer seeded into the database by this file:
 *    it is written through `GET/PATCH /account/screening` on the local engine, by the same
 *    `local-screening.ts` the settings editor calls, over the same shell bridge the window uses.
 *    That closes the half of this feature that was never true on this tier — the words steering a
 *    model the user pays for were readable and unwritable — and it makes the two claims one
 *    sequence: the words were saved over the bridge, and then a model was asked using them.
 *  · **Redaction happened BEFORE the port.** The credential value is absent from the bytes and the
 *    subject matter survives them. `ScreenerService` redacts at the caller precisely because these
 *    two providers receive the input object directly, so a redaction applied inside the bundled
 *    Anthropic builder would protect one implementation of three.
 *
 * ── THE MODEL ANSWERS THE QUESTION IT WAS ASKED, WHICH IS WHY A FALLBACK IS VISIBLE ──────────
 *
 * The stand-in reads the prefix off the request and replies as the real one measurably did: a real
 * pile for the screening question, and `ohmail/Screener` — the tautology — for the routing one. So
 * an install that fell back to `classify` produces `hold` and this file goes red on the ANSWER as
 * well as on the request. That is deliberate: it is the user-visible half of the defect, and a test
 * that only inspected the prompt would pass on a build that had stopped calling `screen`.

/**
 * THE SAME TWO SETTINGS, ON THE WAY IN — the filing loop, not the Screener button.
 *
 * Everything above is about the moment somebody PRESSES something: they ask the Screener what to
 * do with a waiting sender, and a model answers. That is one of the two places these settings are
 * supposed to reach, and it was the only one a standalone install ever wired.
 *
 * The other is ingest. Mail arriving on a laptop was filed by the lenient default posture and
 * judged, where it was judged at all, with no bar in the user turn — while the hosted service read
 * both from the account and threaded them through the same shared pipeline. Two hosts, one loop,
 * two different answers for the same mailbox: the divergence the single-pipeline rule exists to
 * prevent, arriving through the deps rather than through a second copy of the code.
 *
 * It was also a claim already in the tree. `local-screening.ts` told a reader, in as many words,
 * that "the POSTURE is honoured here — `runSyncCycle` resolves it per account and the pipeline
 * files against it". Nothing passed it. Both cases below are red without the read.
 *
 * ── WHY BOTH FIXTURES ADMIT THE SENDER FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Neither setting can do anything to a stranger, by design: an unrecognised sender is answered
 * `ohmail/Screener` before either is consulted, and a decided destination is what stops the
 * pipeline asking a model at all. So the only place these settings act is past the consent gate,
 * and standing there is what these fixtures are for — not a way around it.
